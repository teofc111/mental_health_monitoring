0,1dfj5sc,Feel so weird doing this,"I know this probably not going to help but i just got bored i guess but yea i jus feel like im never gona get out of my situation im turning 20 very soon and im homeless right now, on and off since i was 9 and my head jus isnt right because of how my parents raised me and fed me drugs, i deal with alot of anxiety iety adhd  depression all that shit i feel bad even thinking about tlaking about my life because theres kids out there being beheaded for entertainment, it could always be worse, there is always room to improve, yea , i just want an opportunity but at the same time my head fucks everything up because of my past, irs like i have to get very very very lucky for something to work out, i cant socialize for shit and only hit up my old friends from when i was 14 to cry to, which they dont respond because they all think crazy or just tired of me, ive had psychosis a few times mabye related to drug use but i believe it was influenced by constantly sh series of events i had. Anyways to be happy is jus so far for me , its hard being homeless barely getting sleep, having energy.. i went to a shelter and worked my ass off for 6months year then got drugged and robbed in my sleep(1.5k) so i used my last of my savings and left the shelter. Which was A HALF BLOCK away from tent city(any drug u want) which was not very healthy for me. But yea far from the last time someone has took everything away from me my bestfriend took from me when i was homeless, i let him hold on to my valuables because no matter how tough u are in the streets u can get everything robbed when ur sleeping . But yea dont want to start talking about my past rly . Ive been sober tho, jus smoking weed.. i want to do so much but dont have the capability and every time i got close somebidy has taken it away from me , ive even had my parents take things frok me when we were separeratly homeless, So much time has gone by im so behind, ive always been behind, ive made it close but really i am so far. Its hard to not compare urself to others, that is just instinct, i am tired am afraid i will be homeless forever or fall into a horrible addiction, im trying now but ive tried so hard i just dont know",1,1,new,"**Hello u/!**

3,1dfiq4r,(35M) Is my ADHD part of why I feel like I am hypersexual?,"I'm struggling with what I believe is hypersexuality. I'm constantly feeling horny throughout the day, and it's starting to interfere with my daily life and responsibilities. This persistent sexual arousal is making it hard to focus on work, maintain relationships, and carry out everyday activities.

I've tried various methods to manage these feelings, such as exercise, meditation, and staying busy, but nothing seems to help. I understand that sexual desire is normal, but this level of intensity feels overwhelming and out of control.

I also have ADHD, and I'm unsure if this might be contributing to why I feel hypersexual or horny all the time. I've read that impulsivity and hyperfocus, which are common with ADHD, can sometimes manifest as increased sexual desire, but I'm not sure if that's what's happening in my case.

I'm looking for advice on how to cope with these feelings in a healthy way. Are there any strategies or treatments that can help reduce these urges? Should I consider seeing a therapist or a medical professional, and if so, what type of specialist would be best suited to help with this issue?

Any guidance or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfiq4r/35m_is_my_adhd_part_of_why_i_feel_like_i_am/

7,1dfded0,advice for dealing with financial debt with severe depression,"hi guys. i was debating on even posting this because it genuinely it is one of the most embarrassing and shameful things for me to admit and i don't want people to ever find me saying this on the internet - but i figured since no one even knows i use this account i figured why not ask now and then delete it later.

but regardless, i need serious advice.  

how do you recover from being financially unstable and in debt? i have a full time job already but it's just not cutting it...and i'm looking for a 2nd part-time job but i've had zero luck so far because they need people who will be more flexible with their schedule, and because i already work 8-5, it's hard to find jobs that i can work at in the evening (without it being a fast food restaurant). 

my parents weren't ever really involved in my life and they never really explained the importance of being financially stable, being responsible with your credit card, etc. they aren't really supportive of my mental health either which is why i decided to post it here instead of some financial subreddit. if there's another place i can post this pls lmk.

but anyways, i let it get this bad because my depression is just...so severe. and because my parents are so freakishly unsupportive of anything that's remotely close to mental illness, i've been untreated and i've only seen about 2 therapists both of which have flopped. i did however see a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with bpd and ocd. i'm 22 years old. i've dealt with emotionally and mentally abusive parents for 10+ years, and i've dealt with very toxic relationships that have drained me of me of my money. 

last year i was very very suicidal and had a clear vision in my mind i was going to commit suicide by the end of 2023, and for months i was VERY set on my decision. so i spent way too much money especially on my credit card because in my head i was going to kill myself anyways so there was no point in me trying to get ahold of myself. i've thought about it many many times but i was 100% set with a plan to die at the end of 2023 since i have had nothing to live for, even myself. i made a lot of dumb decisions financially because i truly believed it was the end of my life and i was honestly okay with that. 

obviously now it's june 2024 and things have happened and i'm still alive and somehow surviving. i'm somewhat better than before, considering i've been in a really healthy relationship that's given me some purpose, but i'm still not okay at all. especially now dealing with the repercussions and consequences of my own actions. i work full time monday-friday but the money i make right now isn't enough to cover the debt i have. i babysit every now and then and i'm trying to look for a secondary job but i've had no luck so far. and i'm scared of overworking myself because then i'm really just never gonna prioritize myself at all. i want to move out and better myself (especially since the household i live in is one of the reasons i'm so fucked in the head) but i have no money in my savings because everything just goes towards my credit card and obviously my credit card debt is more than i can handle.

i'm just really stuck. i'm not here to beg for money and i will never ask, all i'm asking for is help and a direction on what to do. i have nobody in my life i can turn to about this and i just don't know what to do.

8,1dfebt4,Should I get counseling?,"About a year ago I wanted to kill myself because I felt like I couldn't make myself do what I wanted to do which made me hate myself to an extreme. Over the course of a few months I went from disappointment to hating myself to fantasizing about bleeding out. 

I didnt act on it (obviously) and I'm glad I didnt. A lot changed for me after that and I started being less of an asshole to myself. Up until recently I didnt ever think back on it but it wasnt until I did, and read the journal I kept, that I realized how fucked I was. I told a friend about it and they told me I should talk to someone and get better coping skills.

I'm worried that since Im okay now that Id be wasting people's time or that I'd be making a bigger deal out of things that I should. I dont really know what I'd say.

9,1dfha1w,"I destroyed my friendship with my best friend, relapsed, and then made everything in my life a thousand times worse."," ~~ I posted this in another subreddit, but figured I could maybe use some kind words or hope if you have any to spare. I‚Äôm out of them myself. I‚Äôll finish the post in the comments due to length. ~~

I‚Äôve been an addict of some sort since I was 15 years old. It started with little white lies and leading a double life out of fear of coming out as trans, evolving into alcohol to cope as a young adult. By the time I finished college, I was taking and abusing pills and meth on a semi-regular basis, and I was a full-blown opioid addict by the time I was 26.

Eventually, I sobered up, started AA, and turned my life around, hitting a year of sobriety. Throughout all of it, one of my best friends, Kyle (name has been changed) stood by my side. For context, I had previously developed romantic feelings for Kyle and was shot down in the kindest of ways, and over time we got closer and closer and became as close of friends as friends could be. My feelings for him never faded, but I just kept them to myself, always respecting his boundaries and never wanting to ruin what we had.

A few weeks ago, I started struggling with my sobriety. I felt the joy of my day to day life starting to slip through my fingers, and the pressure of recovery was becoming too much to handle. But because my life was going ‚Äúso great‚Äù, I started having to look for reasons to justify relapsing; at least, that‚Äôs my theory for why I did what happens next.",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfha1w/i_destroyed_my_friendship_with_my_best_friend/

11,1dfi9vt,what is this?,"So I was overthinking if I should even write this because I'm nervous to hear what people have to say. But let's do it. About 4 months ago I had one of my worst panic attacks resulting in my going to the ER as I completely shut down... (I had had minor ones a few different times but nth as bad as this). I passed it as soon as I went to the ER and was comforted by my family but I was still confused as to why I felt like I was going to die or have some heart attack (what it felt like lol). Ever since that day I struggled for months overthinking ""what if it happens again?"" ""What will I do if that panic attack happens again"" ""no one understands me"" ""I'm doomed I'll never feel normal again"" and over analyzed every. Single. Thing. About how I felt , acted ,etc . just to make sure that I wouldn't ever get a panic attack like that day I mentioned. And guess what? I never did have a panic attack ever since but instead passed through some health anxiety until eventually I got over that and got blood tested , ekg and all that  and realized I'm perfectly healthy and there's no reason to be worried and concerned as to why I had that panic attack and it indeed was just a episode.

NOW 
I'm doing (Thank God) much better;I have my off days (usually days when I'm sad or tired) , where I get a little anxious but it's more of a overthinking feeling as to where I'm over analyzing as to WHY I got that way those 4 months ago. Idk how to word it but it's like almost im traumatized from that panic attack and so disappointed that I let myself get like that and I catch my self remembering the feelings I had weeks after that panic attack in which I'd be depressed and uneasy. Again, I feel fine I just feel sad when I think about those days kind of like I can't get over that phase. I keep overthinking and sometimes worry like ""oh will that happen again?""

Again, I'm better now I really am it's just I wish I never had to go through that phase in my life. Does any one have any advice how to get over what happened and move on with my life? Should I forget it ever happened ? Or should I take it as a learning phase of my life where Wtv happened , happened ?

12,1df8baf,"Feeling lonely, depressed, and with intrusive thoughts about the past","I grew up in an abusive household. My father for sure is a narcissist. I put up with a lot during my childhood and eventually realized that my only way out was college. When time to apply to colleges arrived, I applied to universities that were far away from home. I did not have any support from family members from the moment I moved away for college. Not once did my parents or any family members visited me in college. I recently graduated from professional school and only a friend went to my graduation.

While I have been able to get ahead educationally and likely have a successful career ahead of me, I feel like emotionally I am in shambles. It's difficult to see my friends and peers being so close with their families while I don't have anyone to rely on. While I have friends, I am an introvert and easily mistrust other people. The only semblance of a stable family I ever had was my ex-spouse's. We got together when we were undergrads and split up about two years ago. While my ex has their own share of problems, they put up with my lack of trust for many years, which undoubtedly had a negative impact on the relationship. I've been to therapy and worked through those issues. However, no matter how much I accomplish in life, I feel pretty unfulfilled and lonely, in great part because of the void of not having family members who truly care about me.

Instead, what I have is memories of the abuse. I have only seen my father once since 2010 (and that one time I saw him was only for a couple of hours) but call him occasionally. Whenever I bring up the abuse, he either says he doesn't remember or says something like, ""if you are still resentful about the past, free to pretend I don't exist. What happened to you is nothing compared to what I went through as a child.""

On the ouside I seem like a person who is put together and who has a brilliant life ahead of them, but inside I am in constant agony. I also have dreadful thoughts (like, if something happened to me I would be completely on my own). I am on meds and have been to therapy for years. I have seen some improvement, but all these issues are still pretty much there. It feels as if I am alone and carrying all these heavy and painful memories with me, in addition to the lack of support in my life. I have some friends but I don't want to be a burden to them How can I effectively deal with this?",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1df8baf/feeling_lonely_depressed_and_with_intrusive/

21,1dfhngw,A lot to unwind.,"

I‚Äôm a 17-year-old boy on a plane from New York to Chicago. My life truly began at 15 when I started asking questions and became self-aware. At 14, I watched ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" which changed my life. I wished I could be Spider-Man, sneaking out at night to climb buildings, hoping to become him. When I realized I couldn‚Äôt, I turned to making money. 

At 15, I struggled mentally, feeling like I was going insane. I buzzed my head and spent two summers working non-stop. My thoughts were so overwhelming that I'd run barefoot to Kendrick Lamar at 3-5 am. Last summer, as a sophomore, I felt fulfilled for the first time: working, running, and repeating the cycle. 

This junior year, I made a lot of money and can now travel and buy almost anything. But something is still missing; I never fulfilled my Spider-Man dream. It feels like I chased money because I couldn‚Äôt be Spider-Man. Now, at 17, time feels relentless, and I realize I took my struggles and time for granted. 

I went to New York, hoping for fulfillment, but it didn‚Äôt satisfy me as I thought it would. I can't believe time is passing; I thought I'd stay 15-16 forever. As I near the end of my teenage years, I never got to be a teenager in New York with cool spider friends or scale skyscrapers. The rest of my life seems destined to chase fulfillment through business and helping others, even though those stories aren‚Äôt as cool as being Spider-Man.

They were in a very bad space, they said their Uncle was watching them with cameras and talking bad about them all the time late into the night. I believed this entirely, until they moved with me and my mom and dad. Then they started saying the same things about us, accusing me of cheating on them and saying my parents are watching them with cameras and calling them a variety of negative names. The accussations are so bizarre and plentiful, I can't even explain them all. It has been painful for 4 days, with me getting no sleep before work because I'm up all night trying to explain the truth and looking up ways to handle the delicate situation healthily. I got Gabby's sisters number and talked with her about what to do, and talked to my chemical dependency treatment leader (not sure of their title, they lead these groups I must attend because of my DUI's) , and looked up what I could online and it all led to the same answer: Get them help at the Emergency Room.

My parents said they don't feel safe, and are afraid of getting in trouble for these accusations and they are already stressed out as my mom just found out she has cancer, and my dad is struggling to find a job. They wiill not allow Gabby back after they are discharged.

I don't even know if Gabby will be discharged. I don't know how any of this works. All I know is that Gabby was experience purely auditorial hallucinations, but they were extremely bad, and led Gabby to thoughts of self harm.

About one hour ago I dropped them off, then cried in my car until I got home just to type this out. I was so happy for four months, and the demons Gabby are fighting and the horror that is mental illness stripped away the best friend I had. I feel alone, lost, and am focusing my strength on trying to explore the options for Gabby to be healthier. My job is stressful, I'm going through treatment for my second DUI, and I have no idea what to do. I am not asking for medical advice, that is why they're at the ER.

Do I talk to the social worker they are talking with right now after intake?

Where will Gabby go after being discharged? They have 0 family. They only have their aunt and uncle, which Gabby cut ties with by accusing them of horrible things and leaving with me to my familys. I can't support living with Gabby outside of my familys home, and they need my rent money as well.

If anyone knows any resources to go to, please, I have never wanted help like this before.

They know they were hearing things, but they would have some episodes where it wouldn't stop and they wouldn't accept the reality certain things weren't being said.

Genetic inheritance is a real thing so maybe your concerns are valid.  If you can find a professional with genetic experience to talk to you may learn a lot about it.  Some mental health professionals may have enough anecdotal evidence though experience to talk to this at some level but it's probably not really their area of expertise to discuss the likelihood of genetic markers passing on to your offspring. 

I think the way you and mom act, behave, and raise the child will have a bigger impact on who they turn out to be.  If they see neurosis every day that may become their normal.

It's going to happen. I know this! My cousin (younger than me) passed away in March 2023, my Mom passed away in October 2023, and my brother in January this year. I hurt! Not gonna lie! It's been tough! I just have been trying to deal with things. And on top of that, I have a memory loss issue (pretty serious... like forgetting stuff I SHOULDN'T be forgetting kind of seriousness!). I'm unemployed so I can't afford to go see a specialist to even figure out what it could possibly be. My wife is on disability and she gets SSI so I can't get coverage under her. My brother was 62 when he passed apparently of a heart attack. He didn't even know he had a heart condition. It just all of a sudden got him. I'm almost 59 so, that kind of hits me where it hurts.

So, I'm dealing with some things. Heavy things that I can barely wrap my head around. Like, I want to be here to see my grand-kids. But now I don't know if that's even going to happen. I'm hoping it will, but I could be gone tomorrow without warning. It's part of life and I dealt with that pretty well until my cousin then my brothers passing.

I am looking into a free clinic thing but with something like this, I'm afraid, it won't be free. I'm hoping it'll be way less than it would be going to a regular doctor and getting a referral and all that. But I don't even know if free clinics even look at brain/memory disorders. That seems like a pretty big deal. Something that wouldn't/shouldn't be free or discounted. 

So yeah, the memory loss thing and the family loss thing... It's scaring the ever loving crap out of me at the moment. But I have to be strong and let it ride. I'm going to have fun while I can. I play drums (hence the name) and really, that's the main thing that gives me pleasure these days. Just sitting down at the kit and playing my heart out on them. I'm really having fun doing that. And, I also love my family but I feel bad that if I'm gone within the next couple of years, that'll devastate my wife and my daughter especially... as well as my sister and my father. It's scary! And in some way, I feel like I may be alienating them because I don't want them to feel the devastation I feel now. I don't know what to do... where to turn... If this memory loss thing is simple to fix with medicine then I'm hoping I don't miss that train without insurance and looking for a free clinic that won't be able to figure out what this is. 

I've made a couple of calls this week and I'm waiting for someone to call me back. I will call them again tomorrow and find out where they're at with this. But at the same time, I don't want to worry myself to death... LITERALLY! This is the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with in my life and I hope I can pull through this.

We strive to do better only to lose all in the end. We make connections destined to be severed. We all suffer to survive until we are all one last breath away from the inevitable. We fall short.

I did not choose to wake up yet another day. None of us did. Yet we drag ourselves into the mundane rhythm of life, away from the fresh horrors of our last nightmare. We seem to care while none cares for us. We fool ourselves into thinking that we will do better the next time, the next day. We push ourselves through false hope only to be reminded that there is no time left. We fall short.

All of us are clueless. We just flutter around bumping into things, bouncing off of people, drowning in thoughts, chasing after dreams, and eventually overthinking ourselves to death. We all think our suffering is unique when in truth it is our collective suffering that makes us doomed to fail. In the end, none of it will matter as we will all fall short.

I‚Äôm reaching out because I‚Äôm deeply concerned about my mother‚Äôs behavior and I‚Äôm not sure how to handle it. Over the past few years, she has become increasingly obsessed with alternative therapies and health misinformation she finds online. She constantly complains about various health issues that no doctor has been able to diagnose, and as a result, she avoids traditional medical care altogether.

Instead, she spends a lot of time researching and trying out various alternative therapies like chlorine dioxide, biomagnetism, and even urine therapy. She‚Äôs also heavily involved in online groups that promote these practices and buys into remote therapies and dubious treatments from so-called ""doctors"" she meets online.

She‚Äôs completely distrustful of vaccines and mainstream medicine, frequently shares misinformation, and tries to convince others to adopt her beliefs. I‚Äôve tried reasoning with her and presenting scientific information, but nothing seems to work.

Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you manage to help your loved one? Any advice or strategies would be greatly appreciated.

It's a tough road to navigate. I wish I had better insight on this, but it's above me.

I hope that she sees that the internet is not the answer to everything. Even a religious or guidance counselor may help.

I'm sorry you're trying to help manage this. But it's also up to them to make a decision on what they want. Providing info could help yet doesn't mean it will show them that pros in the field are trained better than armchair online social media influencers. (Sorry, gagged at those last words)

Hopefully something will click to show that there's real people that really deal with this with many clients to help them other than SM stuff that seems... surfaced? I dunno how else to call it.

Proof of Thur 13th June (yesterday as of writing) argument is enough as even when I was broken beyond belief I still tried to de-escalate but can‚Äôt when I am the focal point of the argument. This is further proof I can never open up my true feelings to either of my family as an argument happens 

Before you say that is a lie or even think of denying it just think who you go to in the house when you‚Äôre annoyed, frustrated or dealing with an issue. That‚Äôs right me. I am sure you noticed that when I am the focal point of an argument it escalates as without me to de-escalate no ‚Äúpeace occurs‚Äù.

Dad you say you want to keep the peace then please learn to de-escalate and not escalate like you always do. Don‚Äôt think of denying it as when amber and you argued you wanted to call the police and without me there you would have called the police as you wanted which would have made things worse. 

You dare say I have no empathy when I not only have my emotions and issues weighing on me but yours amber and all my friends. Not even starting to grace the pain and sorrow i went through with mum and as you guessed whenever around mum I was the one de-escalating. 

I am never able to say why I am truly always on my phone and until now I couldn‚Äôt give a true reason but deep down I knew why. Well after the recent argument with you I know why as you distract myself from all the dark emotions I have. 

I can never speak to anyone in this house about anything I am thinking of and never plan to as I have too much of a burden that you don‚Äôt even realise. Just as I was writing this you came upstairs to ‚Äútalk‚Äù but all it was, was mainly you making it worse with you claiming you were de-escalating a potential future argument with amber and myself but nope you weren‚Äôt even if you think you were. To de-escalate you would need a calm face to start but the face you gave then was the complete opposite. You looked at me with a face of disgust and anger nowhere near calm. It is no fault of your own as from what you told me at a young age you weren‚Äôt able to learn how to calmly de-escalate an argument.

But it‚Äôs always me talking them out of it. 

You say no one is there for me. Yeah right I have listened to both of your issues and no one here has listened to mine truly. No one in this house has asked if I am ok. You talk about how you have no one to talk to but subconsciously you both have been opening up to me which you might say is just the surface level but that alone has just forever prevented me from opening up to you. 

Whenever dad has an issue or is demotivated it‚Äôs always me trying to motivate. Whenever amber is down I try to cheer up. Can you think of a time where anyone has tried to cheer me up or tried to motivate me? 

You saying you are dealing with a lot is rich when I am not only dealing with my emotions and feeling but everyone who I have ever helped with no one else to open up to. I even feel like I am just a free therapist to my so called friends. 

I would rather be like you and have no friends then have friends and never be able to open up to them at all about issues but rather take on their issues, problems and emotions asif they are my own. 

When the police were last around I thought it was somewhat a sign that I am the true person that needs help but I don‚Äôt get that. That day I begged them to help you both. I was the only one in the house who kept it together that day and I thought that was a hint that something must be wrong but no. 

Even better as I am writing this amber went upstairs to bed saying good night to you but nothing to me. No ‚Äúare you ok‚Äù or even ‚Äúgood night‚Äù while I am broken and sobbing next room over. 

I am always helping everyone around me and to have no one to ask if I am ok or tell me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you to help me anymore, let me help you‚Äù is heart breaking. 

Whenever I break down around everyone including you both and let out stuff I cannot hold inside anymore you get pissed and annoyed that I am. As it‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt want to hear.

I also took a step further and tried to make an account that makes propaganda videos against the opponent country.

Yet the opponent country is more powerful in this electronic battle of people. When I look at my people, I see they are sad enough to handle them, but I know in the depths of my heart that I cannot do anything by myself for my country, yet I do things that no one will do.

I can't sleep till late hours, something around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m., and all I think about is how to free my country from the sh\*t government, make my people happy, and shut down those who hate us. I dream that my country will become modern and powerful enough to play a role in the this century. I also dream about myself becoming an example in the history of the world, a good person that everyone will remember.

Yet dreaming all that looks too far for me.

Sometimes I get so angry that I like to kill someone from the opponent country to satisfy myself, and sometimes I even don't want to go too far and I want to beat those who I hate daily, yet they are in front of me.

How can I get rid of this f\*cked-up situation that I am stuck in, like an Americans who doesn't care what other people say about their country?

I accept any help.",1,0,new,,
57,1dfea7e,Can anyone give me some suggestions I‚Äôm stuck.,"Guys I could do with some help.

My brother mid 20s and in prison (on remand) he has PTSD and unresolved trauma, he doesn‚Äôt trust anyone in there and cannot talk(trust) to anyone on the wing for support. He has just found out his girl was cheating. He is stress out and anxious. And looking maybe 5+ years inside. Me my self was in prison I‚Äôve done 5 years (I know how stressful prison is) I also have complex PTSD I have done a lot of therapy and resolved a lot of my trauma, I‚Äôm not in the best head space at the moment because of my own circumstances. I want to be able to support my brother, I know he triggers my PTSD and I probably trigger his, this because he is living a life I once did. We have had breakdowns in communication because of it and I feel terrible not speaking to him. I‚Äôm not think clearly enough so I‚Äôm here asking suggestions for how I can be the supporting big brother I know deep down I am. Thanks for reading ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,0,new,,
58,1dfe6ti,Stupid energy and happiness from lifting weights ,"This will be a pretty soft post.

For sports where the strength of your hand movements and grip are used, lifting is usually done every day with about a single repetition with a weight close to your maximum, since for example, in armwrestling, you will need SINGLE explosive movement from your hand, then this training mimics that, being able to do an explosive force just once

And what does this have to do with mental health? I am someone who is quite anxious and stressed, due to the fact that I overthink a lot but for some reason, these lifts throughout my day give me incredible energy and mental fullness. 

I can be studying or working at home and take a 20-minute break and do a single that will leave me calm and energized. 

I would like to know why doing something like this can relax me so much.",1,0,new,,

I just fought with one of my family members. It was after I'd tried to explain that I was at my lowest and felt so alone. The entire argument they kept saying I shouldn't make myself feel bad by crying. Even though that's not how it works. To summarise, my family members made me reach the point where I had to literally beg them to stop talking 'cause it was driving me insane. I dug my nails into my face and accidentally scarred myself.

Hormonal changes may play a role
Just as with mums, changes in hormones might make postnatal depression in dads more likely (Saxbe et al, 2017). Hormones including testosterone, oestrogen, cortisol, vasopressin, and prolactin may change in dads during the period after their babies arrive (Kim and Swain, 2007).

Only until after we separated did I start feeling like I was happier. I'm not saying it's your partner or anyone. But taking an inventory of your wants and why's are a good start. After I started learning how to be me again (2 years and still learning) I became happier and healthier. Plus, this kid will make the perspective of your world different. So hold and talk to your partner with what you need. Keep communication open so when you do more activities or focus more on you or any other third thing, it would feel like it's not just you but a group effort. Because that's what family is. A group support system. I hope I didn't ramble too much and I hope this helps. Best of luck to you.

I'm 24 now but I feel like I always have felt indifferent about pretty much anything. I like some things, I have hobbies and things I wanna become but I'm not obsessed about anything. I like my hobbies but if for some reason I stopped tomorrow, I would be perfectly fine. All of the people I know have something that they say they cannot live without. It's not the same with me. I may like something but deep down I don't really care about it. It's not the end of the world for me if I can't do it for some reason. 

Also I have never felt emotions that deeply. I've loved someone some years back and I still love them, but I can still live my life without them so I don't mind. Even family members. I love them and I don't want something bad to happen to them, but even if something happens, serious or not, I need to really push myself to remember to care about them. 

Also on the topic of death, I feel totally ok with it. Even when I lost my grandparents, I pushed myself to cry so that others can see that I care. But I wasn't feeling anything. I didn't feel sad, happy, anger. I didn't feel anything.

A lot of times I think that I don't feel that much. Maybe I know how I should feel but in the end of the day I don't care that much. It won't change the universe whatever happens.

Idk what happened I used to be content with how I looked and then boom I felt unrecognizable, I hate myself , my face , my forehead , my cheeks , my chin , my lips , my stomach , I hate it all . 

And I can't help but think why am I so ugly ? So fat , why do I gain the weight the way I do ? Why am the ugliest of them all. 

I feel embarrassed and I can't help but think this is why I'm single

I can't help but think I don't deserve love because of my weight , because of my face . 

It's such a horrible and ugly way to think but I cant help it .

I take selfies I look good with filters of course
Someone takes a picture of me and I am absolutely shattered by what I see .

An oger ... A monster . Ya I really do see myself like that . And I can't stand it anymore I'm always in a shitty mood. I can't even be a good mom because I'm always ashamed of myself I pass by a store with glass windows and see my reflection and I am automatically distraught .. pissed .. upset . 

I blame myself for being like this no one else . 

Idk . I wasn't always like this . And it's gotten really bad . 

Mh aunt randomly messaged me saying she's proud of how far I've come. 

And all I can think of , is how far I haven't come .

70,1dfcjxs,Big psychological problems since childhood - I want to find what I have...,"Hi there!

I'm a French student. This is the first time I'm posting on an English-speaking sub (sorry in advance for my English, by the way). 

To sum up my problem, I feel like my whole being is based on psychological problems, and I still don't know the source of these problems.

I started having a lot of OCD at the age of 11. For reasons I won't go into here, I had horrible school hours (7.30 a.m. - 6.15 p.m.), and when I got home, I'd eat a little and work (homework) until 11 p.m.. 

I've done nothing but work all my life, I think because it was the only thing I felt respected for. In fact, despite all these years of working like crazy, I've always had a lot of trouble concentrating. 

Often when I'm working, I feel pressure in the back of my head, and I get stressed/ intrusive thoughts. When I do something well, I have a little voice in my head telling me ""that's good"" but to put pressure on me and I find it even harder to concentrate.

Today is my 22nd birthday, and I have the feeling that chemically, my brain doesn't want to allow me to be happy. I still have this permanent pressure in my head, this feeling of being limited in what I have to do, and I'd like to know where it comes from, what causes it?

71,1dfch5c,Hereditary Lack of Empathy ,"Hey folks‚Ä¶ kind of a thought / vent / question I guess‚Ä¶ trying to think of where to even start 

Ever since I was a child, a long as I can remember I have had a complete and total lack of empathy, like zero empathy. I didn‚Äôt know what to call it at the time, but as I‚Äôve gotten older that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve realized it to be. 

Someone could tell me their dog died last night, and everyone around me would be emotional and ‚Äúoh my god im so sorry‚Äù and in my head I would have zero emotion whatsoever, like it didn‚Äôt even matter at all 

This has obviously led to some challenges in life, specifically with my spouse and trying to see others point of views. 

It‚Äôs challenging because in arguments I would basically have zero idea ‚Äúwhat the big deal is‚Äù meanwhile everyone else is saying they can‚Äôt believe I don‚Äôt understand why someone is upset/sad/etc etc 

For several years now I‚Äôve been told by others I lack empathy, so I‚Äôve tried to find ways to ‚Äúmanually‚Äù cope with this problem‚Ä¶ for example if someone said their dog died, I would say oh man I‚Äôm so sorry‚Ä¶. Even though I personally feel nothing about it, I just know via societal norms it‚Äôs just the right thing to say‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm basically solving the problem via superficial ‚Äúemotional intelligence‚Äù more so then having any real thought or opinion or feeling on the matter 

Well recently I took one of those Genetic / DNA Tests and low and behold I got an alert saying that quote ‚ÄúI may lack empathy‚Äù because of a genetic mutation that actually physically makes it hard for me to chemically / emotionally have a reaction to these matters - so basically the entire things been genetic this entire time 

The problem obviously, is I don‚Äôt know any way to ‚Äúfix‚Äù this , other then just trying to keep ‚Äúfaking it‚Äù and making sure I use proper language in empathetic situations without actually understanding at a deep level how it feels or what the issue is. 

Has anyone else ever felt or been this way? ",3,2,new,"there isn‚Äôt really a way to ‚Äúfix‚Äù this, and you‚Äôre not a bad person or anything for not feeling empathy. it‚Äôs also not awful to not understand others emotions, it happens to everyone occasionally but obviously the issue here is that it happens very often.

it‚Äôs ok to not feel anything when others are having a bad time and you‚Äôre going to just stress yourself out trying to force it, but i think if you try to turn your attention more towards being curious about why someone feels that way you‚Äôll have a better time connecting with others.

in general it‚Äôs actually the best to ask a lot of questions when someone is feeling shitty, so it serves a double purpose of helping you understand others in a more logical sense and helping them out too (score: 1) | I struggle with empathy myself. Definitely look into cognitive empathy vs. emotional empathy! Cognitive empathy involves knowing how other people think and feel, while emotional empathy involves feeling another person's emotions. When I was diagnosed with personality disorders (not that you may have that) this is a big thing my psychiatrist differentiated and helped me understand in my own thinking/feeling patterns.

I personally struggle with emotional empathy while my cognitive empathy is much stronger. My cognitive empathy is what gets me through my social interactions. I‚Äôve never done any genetic testing so I couldn‚Äôt tell you if I fall into that category. Though low-level empathy does run behaviorally in my family. If it‚Äôs not really causing you distress don‚Äôt worry about it. I‚Äôm not sure if you could fix this tbh. Hope this helps!

I mean, sure, there's no law against sharing your opinions, is there? And the fact that something might make someone feel awful **on its own** is not sufficient grounds to stop yourself from saying that thing. I mean, on the one hand, in scenario A, you might just be being mean; on the other hand, in scenario B, someone might be a horrible abuser and you might just be calling them out, which might make them feel awful ‚Äî but you have the right to do it anyway.

Everyone is going to feel differently to a situation. Some may be redoing the same situation over and over with same outcome. I don't see an issue pointing it out as they can bring it up in their sessions and understand that each person will respond different. You may expect a ton of sympathy, but you know what? That doesn't excuse your own behaviors nor does it let you off from being a jerk. I have mentally unstable friends.. I have one now trying to figure things out yet messages me with these slighted or digging into me where it makes me want to break. But, I won't break.

I don't want to ruin my own mental health for theirs.

You're not their carer, unless you decided to be. As an adult, they should seek resources. If they're underage, their parents should be doing so.

Mental health isn't an excuse for being ""bad and ruining other people's lives."" Far from it. Most is projection from my experience. Don't let the burnout get to you if it's going on and on. Provide resources, let them know to seek help because you're not a professional. You're there for support to the point it doesn't affect your daily life.

82,1dfax7e,How to find friends ,"Hello,

I'm quite lonely and I struggle a lot with it.

I currently have no friends and I feel like I can't change that in any way. I think I don't seem very attractive or interesting to people. I can't keep up with the expectations of others.

I'm introverted and have some kind of social anxiety but I think I got better with this. I talk with others at work and in normal situations and its not the extreme issue it ones was.

But my biggest issue remains. When I was around 13 (I'm 25 by now) I basically quit my social life because people became weird and I extremely disliked alcohol and stuff. I had some online friends every now and then but it never really got anywhere in the long run. So I mostly played games and learned stuff like progamming.

Because of that I have quite some deficits when it comes to social Interactions especially in real life. I didn't do anything most people do in their teenage years. I lack a lot of experiences and even knowledge about myself. Like I don't know what kind if partner I would like to have.

A few years ago I tried to catch up but I'm unable to do so. People reject me because I don't meet their standards and expectations. Sadly without others I can't really navigate in real life. I don't know many things people see as common knowledge and when it comes to stuff like partying its even dangerous to go alone as someone like me. I can only imagine how a day out with friends would feel like.

What should I do? I don't seem to be able to make progress.

I start to get quite depressive from time to time. My logical thinking naturally keeps me away from worse conditions. I not used to much emotions anyway so resisting is not that hard. But the pain is still real and I would like a better social life.

I currently work a remote job so that doesn't really help with this.

I also won't fake any interest in stuff like sport that I don't actually have any interest in. I refuse to lie in such a shitty way. I don't need friends that I have to lie to first.

I'm greatful for any help!",1,0,new,,

I have a very consistent practice, and cross trained intensely in a number of systems. At some point I got very good at managing negative upwellings like anxiety and depression. But it was still work and energy depleting and what I wanted was a fundamental change.

I created a method of trying to dog train it away, thinking that it was a habit of the mind. So I tested this out a few times - on a later experiment that lasted for 3 months anytime I'd, say, be anxious, I'd click a tally counter, and do a simple reframe, graphing it across time. That worked immensely, but not completely. I then attempted to do the same thing for all negative emotions, and that didn't quite work, despite trying multiple forms of reframing or or quick meditation across 5 months. A lot of the issue is that in order for the retraining to happen it has to be a really quick almost push button effect.

All of that however did make me much more aware of my mind's habits.

More recently I did a pretty intense trauma reprocessing class, where we churned through them. Part way during the class I realized this one technique - an age regression and memory reprocessing technique - worked phenomenally well to take out triggering behavior - I would start to notice my mental patterns changing - triggering instances would sail by. So after the class I just continued to churn through traumas and negative experiences for several months.

A few months ago I realized that the anxiety I had for as far back as I can remember was gone, and so was the depression I developed at age 11.

I'm too tired to look it up but the neuronal path that experiences are processed through to make it to long-term memory is circumvented in amygdala inducing (traumatic) experiences.

My tired brain is gonna make it real dumb simple haha (for me fun)

normal stimuli -> brain -> hippocampus -> pre-frontal cortex & memory 
trauma stimuli -> brain -> high amgydala response -> worse hippocampus to memory pipeline -> less pre-frontal cortex use and more sensory input please

94,1df9ife,How to get motivation back for summer,"This happens every year. Spring starts and I'm happy and excited for summer. The last month before summer break, however, is filled with tests and exams, which causes so much stress and anxiety that I lose motivation to do anything, even the things I enjoy. I feel like I'm put on survival mode instead of living. Then boom, in an instant it's summer. Without any responsibilities or the time to adjust and fix my mental health again, I just lose the will  to do anything, because there is no reason for me to get out of bed or do anything. I usually manage to fix this about halfway through summer.

I would like to do something about it earlier this year, but I don't know how to break the cycle, because I truly don't have the will to do anyhting right now.

106,1df8e0x,Can I become less emotionally numb and more empathetic or is this just my personality?,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place but I could really use some advice as I‚Äôve been trying to change this for years but feel stuck. I feel like I‚Äôve always had a very dampened emotional experience compared to other people. I‚Äôm like the opposite of a sensitive person, I‚Äôm pretty indifferent to most things and nothing really bothers me or if they do I can get over it pretty quick. I do feel emotions but most of the time they‚Äôre not very strong or they pass very quickly. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is because of my worldview - I‚Äôm quite ‚Äòexistential‚Äô bordering on nihilistic tbh and life feels meaningless. I feel like I‚Äôm always searching for ‚Äòmore‚Äô from life and would describe living as boring, kind of like ‚Äúis this it?‚Äù In that way I suppose I‚Äôm some version of depressed but atypically so. 

Anyway because I‚Äôm like this I find it really hard to relate to other people‚Äôs experiences which always seem to be quite emotionally charged. E.g. I‚Äôve always found the notion of anxiety to be confusing as I can‚Äôt imagine caring about anything enough to be anxious about it. It simply is not that deep (to me). But I don‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm like this because I can‚Äôt effectively support my friends when they share certain experiences. I just can‚Äôt get my head around why they care so much. 

I‚Äôve not long finished a 15 month stint of therapy to tackle this issue but I don‚Äôt think it helped at all. I haven‚Äôt had any trauma and I‚Äôve lived a pretty normal life up till now. Is this just how I am, or is there any way I can‚Äôt start feeling more? Any advice would be appreciated!",3,3,new,"hi! i think the issue here is that you don‚Äôt know what to say when people come to you with problems

when people come to me i will usually
1) identify the emotion that they are feeling, this makes them feel ok for feeling this emotion and more secure talking to you
2) ask them a question about what they are talking about, this can help get to the ‚Äúroot‚Äù of the issue, often times if you repeat step 2 enough they will get to it by themselves and figure it out, it‚Äôs best to work as a ‚Äúbouncing board‚Äù until they feel better
3) if there is something that comes up that you think you can do to help them in that moment then ask them if that would help

in practice this can look like this:

‚Äúuhg i have a test tomorrow‚Äù
‚Äúoof that sounds stressful, are you going to have time to study for it?‚Äù
‚Äúyeah i just am having trouble getting the motivation to‚Äù
‚Äúwould it help to study together?‚Äù

if you can‚Äôt feel the first one, you‚Äôre unfortunately just not going to, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre bad though, just that to connect with others you need to rely more on your cognitive empathy

it can actually be a strength, as people who experience empathy in the emotional sense can at times let those emotions get to them and they end up not being the best person to talk to because of that, because you don‚Äôt, you don‚Äôt have to deal with that and can stay more levelheaded and stable which is invaluable to many (score: 1)",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1df8e0x/can_i_become_less_emotionally_numb_and_more/
107,1df8ds5,I feel like I am being judged at every given point in my life!!!,"I have come to a point in my life where I am stuck with the feeling that I am being judged no matter what I do. To give a little insight on my upbringing and current situation, I was raised in a religious household, dragged to church every Sunday morning, night, and most Wednesday nights. Through these experiences I remember a threat that was held over my head throughout childhood. Something along the lines of if I don't do right by the Lord I'm going to hell. This has put me in a position where I don't want anything to do with religion because I feel like no matter what I do I will be judged, but as I've taken time and given myself space away from that subject I don't feel any better. There is still something in the back of my mind that says ""watch out serious platypus, you don't want to end up in hell."" This judgment comes from everywhere whether or not it is actually true is a different story.

I know a lack of self-esteem can be a major cause of this as well as social anxiety which is something that I have been diagnosed with. I've been speaking to my therapist about this situation as well, and today I was requested to seek out answers from somewhere online. Reddit is the first place I thought about going because my name is obviously not Serious Platypus so it is a little easier to open up here.

These experiences grew, and as I fought through the troubles of childhood, clinging on to writing I eventually came to a point that sent me on a downward spiral...

I remember the day that my passion for letting people read what I have written was stopped dead in it's tracks. As childish as it sounds, there was a girl in school that liked, and she wanted me to write something for her. So I did. After school that day she read what I wrote, and ripped it up in front of me and just dropped it like it was nothing. I feel like my confidence in writing and self esteem in general was crushed at that point, and ever since then (it's been a while) I've been struggling with putting words on paper that I am proud of, or that I feel like won't get torn up in front of my eyes. But here I am reaching out for help.

How do I rekindle my self-esteem and not feel like I am being judged at every corner of my life? And most importantly, how do I reignite the passion that I once had instead of just sitting around and waiting for the end. I know I have just written a lot, but I feel like I am in the bottom of a well trying to climb out with no rope or footholds.

Can anyone help?",1,1,new,"oh my god that girl was awful. she likely was a bitch to begin with and asked you to write it just so she could fuck you up, i don‚Äôt think it was your writing that made her rip it up, it really sounds like that was what she was planning on doing beforehand

The more positive experiences you have and the less negative ones the easier things will get.

If this is too much, make friends with women and go on solo hang-outs with them. The only difference is sexual and romantic expression. But teasing, joking, and having fun are all things you can enjoy as a light hearted no commitment experience. 

If flirting and sexual/romantic expression is the source of your difficulties try searching for websites where you can practice flirting and teasing strangers. Fetlife is a fetish social media platform with lots of people networking and chatting and exploring their sexuality together, It could be a good start. Then you can seek out  a sex worker and see about regularly having a ‚Äúdating experience‚Äù, or a ‚Äúgirlfriend experience‚Äù where they flirt with you and just simulate a date. No kissing, no touching, just a beautiful woman flirting with you. You can express that you are specifically really scared to date and you would like to practice and get more comfortable flirting and chatting and figuring out what you need to improve on and get more comfortable with. They would be happy to help you for the right price. But it would be expensive.. that said, the price of liberation from your fears of what holds you back from your dreams is often well worth it.

The relationship is still new and we are on holiday together right now. So i just experienced it for the first time and don't know how to react. 

We were sleeping cuddled together in bed,  i woke up because my arm fell asleep from cuddeling so i tryed to move it. 

That startled her. She jumped up from bed, made loud noises that were not understandable, but she clearly panicked and ran to the door. To note, this all happened in 1-2 seconds, very fast. She was 100% sleeping and not moving at all before this happened. 

I was shocked myself and didn't understand what is going on and how to react at first. I catched her before she left the hotelroom and tryed to calm her down. First she tryed to fight me but she quickly calmed down and fell asleep immidiatly again.

Today i talked with her about this and she can not remember anything but she had a similair thing happen to her in the past, one time she tryed to run to the forest in the middle of the night but her mom catched her before she left the property of their house. 

Can this be a mental condition? How should i handle this?

I didn't expect her to really try to run all of a sudden, if she really leave the hotelroom it will be difficult to find her, espescially when I am asleep when this happens the next time. i think it will also be dangerouse for herself since she don't remember anything, maybe she will run on a busy street or get lost in a foregin country. 

I think she has some other mental problems too, but i still did not confirm them.  One of them is probably an eating disorder since she feels stomach ache every time she eats a little more food. But she eats very little food all the time, it is impossible to feel full with this, she is also very skinny and underweight.

I am not really convinced about this yet. But i will let her try for a while and push her to do therapy if it doesnt get better.

yr describing my life pretty well (score: 2) | BPD. Sounds like someone who's been through narcissistic abuse. Your not connected to your intuition. (score: 2) | That last sentence I can relate to. Can you tell more about it. (score: 3) | So narcissists want control, they disconnect you from your intuition with various tactics. The main one is gaslighting. Gaslighting is anything to make you think that you are crazy and cannot trust your own mind. So they may move your stuff around, so when you go looking for something, everything is out of place, it disorients you. It can get very sinister and dark, for instance my father used to play whispering and scratching sounds on a speaker when I slept or was in the shower.

I suppose they do this so they can get away with abusing you. Your so out of tune with your inner voice that they can just straight up deny doing something and because your mind is so chaotic you can't really argue with them. They'll ask you ""oh, whens one time I've done that?"", and you cannot give them an answer. My Dad got away with sexual abuse, because he pushed me to the point where I didn't even trust my own memories.

They'll make you dependant, by any means necessary. It's pretty disgusting and does a whole lot of damage to the victim. It makes me sick to my stomach. 

Narcissists can be very covert. You may have no idea your being abused.

He said something which I could not understand. I took 4-5 seconds but basically trying to understand but was actually blank during those seconds and accepted it. Is it just regular experience or low self confidence or what you said. (score: 2) | These things go hand in hand. If you where a victim or narcissistic abuse then you would have low self esteem/confidence. Idk if the guy was trying to fuck you over or not though. 

Going blank could just be because you don't know wtf he's talking about.

124,1df5sro,Emotionally numb ,"I am now 18 and I‚Äôve had a deeply volatile and traumatic childhood, my dad was cruel to me in my young years and kept introducing new ‚Äústep mothers‚Äù into my life and would expect me and my two younger siblings to cooperate and accept these new family cultures and ways of life immediately every time. 
I won‚Äôt go on for too long I hope, but when I was 12 he introduced me to my third step mother (his third relationship since he and my mum divorced when I was 5). 

She was nice at first but I always felt something off about her. She went on to be emotionally abusive, cruel and manipulative for the entirety of their relationship until six months ago, when she up and left out of absolutely nowhere. 

I have experienced a lot of abandonment and abrupt change in my life, when my other step mums left, through various other family conflicts, and this time too - my dad and her have a child together, my sweet youngest brother. She also had two younger children who were my step siblings for 7 years. Her cruel parents also lived with us for the majority of their relationship and they are now gone too. 

I can‚Äôt feel emotional about it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel any emotional attachment or sentiment to the whole situation. 

I can‚Äôt even really process the traumas I went through but all I know is that I feel like I am avoiding even trying. 

I had a lot of physical, emotional and sexual abuse through this time, I also dealt with depression and very high levels of anxiety due to significant traumas I witnessed and experienced, however I  had to always keep my thoughts and feelings hidden to avoid conflict between the family as she was very controlling and I was forbid to speak up.  

Why don‚Äôt I feel sad or angry or hurt? I feel nothing, it feels like nothing ever happened. 

I love my brother and her kids so much yet I never get to see them anymore, they left our home one day and never came back. I don‚Äôt even know where they live. 

I feel unavailable to everyone and like I don‚Äôt want a reason to see her but I really want my siblings to be ok and I feel a responsibility to make sure that happens, as I am the oldest.


Is it normal to feel this empty? Or indifferent? I feel like a crazy person like I don‚Äôt know how to regulate a normal emotional response to this and other things going on in my life. ",2,0,new,,
125,1df5ko1,I don't think I'm getting better,"Hi, I'm turning 20 in November, yet I feel like there really isn't much to life. The idea of graduating with a degree, pursuing a career that I'm passionate about, building a family all seems so mundane to me.

I truly envy others who seemingly know what they're doing and wasting no time, thinking about useless stuff like what I'm doing to work towards their goals. I sound like a lazy person that's complaining about every minute thing right now, but the truth is I probably am. But I like to think that I've put an effort to not feel this way but yet I feel nothing.

I feel disconnected from everyone. Parents speak about trusting God and his plans. Good friends all have sound advice for me to deal with this feeling, however I've never been able to resonate with any of it. I'm truly lost. Perhaps I'm finding an excuse to working hard by feeling this way. Maybe not. Either way I'm feeling it.

I used to blame my parents for my upbringing. It may as well be their fault for me being like this. Eventually I've come to accept that holding it against them solves nothing, so I blame myself. I really see no possible future where I can love existing as  the person that I am. I have no idea who I am anymore. Everyday I have a hundred thoughts for every single thing I want to do. It's exhausting and I don't think I can do it anymore.

I'm scared of the pain of dying. But sometimes I wish I had the balls to do it. This whole life thing is not working out for me no matter what bullshit mindset I'm forcing myself to have. I'm gonna start praying I don't wake up the next day starting from tonight.

Thanks in advance to the 3 people that will see this post, I hope I was able to articulate well how I'm feeling. I appreciate any nice words. I'm really lost right now.",6,1,new,"One quote lately in my mind is of Henry Thoreau. ""**The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.**""   
  
A kind of truth is that no one knows what they're doing or they just accept it as such, everything at face-value, embracing it, becoming it. They silently accept a generic sense of culture - as in predetermined ways or patterns to live, according to one's cultural norms.  
  
I don't have a lot of nice words, as im in the same boat so to say. Im you, a decade later, and in another environment. People mostly advise themselves when giving advice, believing their belief once again, making it more solid, out of their self and placing it in a form of reality through communication. Usually people don't like other people drifiting away from long-held accepted ways of living because if their attempts are successful they will be reminded of their own predicament, so they try to stop them subconsciously and/or actively. Apparently these are my understandings, i might be wrong, so take it with a grain of salt (yummy :) - but not much (yikes :( ). 

Therapy sometimes helps, at least with making some sense and drawing some narrative lines of what you're thinking about. It's not the solution of course (frankly there is no solution - but that doesn't mean you're not gonna feel different sometime/somewhere - it's that life is REALLY open to interpretation). 

You're full of doubt and questions. For me that's completely ""healthy"" and i'd really like for everyone to be like that. But questions birth more questions and people get tired. How to solve their tiredness is not only of this discussion, but it has diversifications in other branches too (social sciences, economics, philosophy etc).

127,1df55sb,My mediocrity kills my motivation ,"I know we roughly speaking are all average, with some exceptions no doubt. However I am not one of those exceptions instead I am intoxicated with the delusion of unworthiness. I know I‚Äôm not prone to failure anymore then the average person is- but I don‚Äôt feel like that. I struggle with the idea that I can be normal- have an intimate relationship, have friends and have a skill. I know logically that I can- I‚Äôm not prevented in any significant way from having that but despite this I don‚Äôt feel normal. It‚Äôs strange to me- I have everyone around me I‚Äôm doing well, teachers, parents. Yet I feel like they are lying to me, even if I know they are not. 

I tried hobbies guitar, bass, piano, creating adventure maps in video games. Yet I quit- I do enjoy them I really do but then I listen to music or play an actual game, or try to get people to try my game. Then I hate my voice, my dexterity, my ability, my creativity. It‚Äôs not terrible but it‚Äôs average. I need to accept that because some people don‚Äôt have talent and that‚Äôs okay. I know it‚Äôs okay but I don‚Äôt feel okay, I feel useless, pointless, helpless. 

For my career choice I‚Äôm going to study physics and I feel much the same. I do absolutely love to learn about the universe and its laws. I find it endlessly fascinating, but I‚Äôm definitely not the smartest person in our school. I likely won‚Äôt discover quantum gravity, or anything significant and likely just contribute nothing.

My point is that it bothers me. I find it repulsive to be normal and it‚Äôs been damaging me my entire life, I‚Äôm unable to form relationships, fall in love, and stick with anything because I‚Äôve given up on the normal despite knowing I‚Äôm not a savant but yet I‚Äôm emotionally pretending to be one. I‚Äôm graduating high school now, my last day was a few days ago and I‚Äôm driving myself insane, everywhere I look I see people with potential so high, with a fire so deep. Yet I‚Äôm wasting away typing on my phone on a post no-one is going to read because I don‚Äôt know what the hell I‚Äôm going to do, I scorned my ability to be normal despite lacking the talent to justify it.

When I was 12 i used to cut myself in the bathroom because I didn't want to go on, I made progress since (i am now in my 20s), but i think this is the end of the road for me. I have lost two close family members, one very young, one very old, over the last one year. I suspect that has made it worse. I have a boyfriend who loves me and I feel tremendous amounts of guilt wanting to die this badly, but I just feel like it needs to be done. I don't feel satisfaction in my work, I don't feel like I have great friendships and even at times when I did I never felt like life was worth living.

I focus on things that shouldn't be focussed on, I'm materialistic to the point of self-hatred. I have tried speaking with professionals before but there is something so unappealing about it that I'm struggling to go back even though my boyfriend keeps encouraging me to.

A friend of mine who I‚Äôve not spoken to since high school has been dealing with what he calls Gang Stalking or Cyber Stalking. It is essentially the belief that he is living the life of Jim Carey in the movie The Truman Show. The belief that everyone is an actor and all interactions are tests performed by a powerful entity.

He fantasizes of MAID but is currently unable to receive it because it‚Äôs not outlined in law that people with this mental illness are eligible for it.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Question #1 : How should I (or anyone) deal with someone who is exhibiting this illness? 

I have already told him that I am on the side him, the part that is aimed up, so I will not rally for amendments with MAID (I would not rally for it for anyone. No one should have a ‚Äòcompassionate killing from the government‚Äô).

Question #2 : (context) He is also atheistic, which I also was for 15 years, but I‚Äôve come to learn that reality isn‚Äôt only made up of facts and matter, but also how to act in the world. What is the world made of vs how to act in the world. He has done something that strongly goes against the moral order (not murder, but I should not share) which I feel he is having a hard time processing as he does not have and has not had the proper moral framework to deal with the evils of the world and within each person individually, including himself. 

(Question) Does the lack of a moral order outside of one‚Äôs self create the environment where you could be subject to an OCD/Bipolar/Schizophrenic state? Due to the fact that it can be absolutely terrifying to realize the evil capacity within one‚Äôs self? As opposed to the atheist claim along the lines of ‚Äòwe‚Äôre all basically good, just be good and everything will be alright‚Äô.

136,1df0whb,Thought I witnessed my cat die,"I was coming home late from the gym the other night, and saw a fox biting on a cat in the middle of the road , so ran over and scared the fox off. Looked down and noticed  (at that moment) it was my cat. Neck sliced and blood pouring out, motionless but she was still warm. It was around midnight, and so nobody was around, and I didn't know what to do. I felt myself start to tear up, gently stroking her, apologising for not getting there quicker, apologising for not letting her on my lap the previous day. She looked so defenseless and harmless laying there, and it didn't make sense that something so cute and harmless had such a violent exit in the world. I started to cry, because of what she went through, and how guilty I felt, and how much is will hurt my family when I tell them. 
I stood over her, diverting the odd car that came by. Some people stopped and asked, I answered, and they showed compassion, and I felt bad that they felt bad they couldn't 'help'.
After about 15 minutes standing over her in the rain, I mustered up the courage to take my jumper off and pick her up to carry her home. 
After a few attempts, and constantly muttering 'sorry' to her, I carried her back home. She was the daughter of our older cat, and I was terrified to go into the house and bring this news. 
I went in, went upstairs and woke my parents up as I didn't know what to do, through whimpers and light cries, I told them I found her dead on the street (all whilst holding her in the dark in my arms). They were obviously confused and upset, and we went downstairs, only to find my cat by the backdoor- pawing to get out. I realised I had brought a random dead cat home. Laughing, crying, confused, angry, stunned. I was feeling everything. 
Very fortunate that it was not my cat, but very sorry that it was someone else's. 
I had felt like I had to go through the stages of grief just to pick her up and carry her home and move forwards, only to find out that it wasn't my cat. 

After calming down, and questioning whether I'm an idiot for not recognising it wasn't my cat, I showed a picture to my family, and they were all certain they would have mistaken her for our cat aswell. 

I didnt realise I felt so strongly for my pet. I knew I cared and loved her etc, but it was a large shock to what extent. Perhaps it was the situation that made it worse. 

This happend 3 days ago, and still I don't feel emotionally back to normal. 
I kept telling myself when I was out there in the road, trying to pick her up, that it's 'just a cat', 'just pick her up', 'stop being overdramatic and just do it, you can't leave her out here'. 

Don't really know why I'm posting it here, but it was just such a huge emotional roller coaster, and I just needed to vent it. ",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1df0whb/thought_i_witnessed_my_cat_die/

143,1df3xkz,Residential care for 8-year-old with pediatric bipolar?,"My 8-year-old son has been struggling with mental illness for a couple of years now, and after several psychiatrists, medication regimens, and fruitless therapy sessions, we are looking at residential programs. This is an incredibly hard decision, but he has become violent, actually injuring me (his father), his mom, and his older brother many times. Property destruction is in the thousands at this point. Last week he began threatening self-harm, and at that point I began to surrender to the inevitability of hospitalization. 

He's been diagnosed with pediatric bipolar disorder, but as you know, psychiatric diagnoses pre-puberty are dicey. At the very least, I can say that he becomes explosively angry over unpredictable things (i.e. his pajamas are in the wash, his cat doesn't come when called, we're out of bananas). He has also begun sobbing fits over similarly unpredictable matters -- not just fit-pitching, but episodes that look like a grieving child. His last month of the school year was marred by a dozen absences when he simply refused to go -- crawling under his bed crying. When we actually made it to school, he frequently vomited (I'm pretty sure he has learned to throw up at will), and we had no choice but to pick him up. Needless to say, the outlook isn't auspicious.

The main thing I'm obsessing over which causes me great shame and guilt is from a couple of years ago. In work (while in my current relationship, we have 2 kids together) I became quite infatuated with a colleague who is married. One day he held the lift for me and called me over. I thought nobody was around, and there was definitely some flirtatious body language and eye contact between us. It would have looked like we were about to kiss if someone saw us. It turns out someone did and he used every occasion since to make thinly veiled comments about it and it was clear he was trying to makee feel ashamed and for all I know he thinks we were having some kind of affair. The man involved started receiving these comments too from the other colleague, and became very hostile towards me and then moved to another team. I feel so dreadful and idiotic about the whole thing and I feel like I've gotten mysef a reputation as some sort of dangerous homewrecker, though I have no evidence anyone has been gossiping about it. I wish I could go back and change my interaction with him that day. I've never cheated in my life and it would never have come to that.

Just my 2 cents (score: 3) | I appreciate it. So to dive a little deeper. With my dissociative part of my PTSD, I have a really hard time regulating my emotions when it come to stress, anger, sadness. In some extreme events some involving alcohol and some not, when I couldn't regulate I become like a different person? If that makes sense lol. My therapist and I call him Clarence. She says its not necessarily a bad thing but it becomes an issue in a situation when I lose control almost like I am back seating my own body, I then don't remember much of what happens or remember it incorrectly. IE - Things other people said and what I think they said etc etc. I lose my concept as time 4 hours feels like 20 minutes. Now I haven't had an episode really since I went sober and began seeking help and working on myself. Could it be this part of my mind is trying to communicate with me while I sleep?

P.S- Yes, my medical professionals are aware of this and we are currently working on emotion regulation and how to navigate stressful situations. I am purely just asking for outside perspective as my therapist had a family emergency this week and I haven't had a chance to speak with her.

161,1df0xlh,What are your tips for adhd at work ? ,"I have all adhd symptops, but diagnosis and pills are pretty exhausting and I'm afraid harder stimulants will not work for me and I already have liver problems. 

I'm struggling to sit down and concentrate for longer time- my mind wander and I like this state, but I just don't want to get fired. What are your tips to control that ?

I'm using coffee, breathtechniques, and nicotine paths.",34,16,new,"There are a lot of different task I have to do at work and here is how I focus on each:

Doodling helps if I'm only having to listen to something.

Fidget toys could help if I have to read.

 Taking notes keep me present mentally if I'm having to talk to someone. 

And lastly I have to listen to music while I do my data entry.

I still spend a lot of time zoned out but the above helps me get through what I have to accomplish daily. (score: 24) | >Fidget toys could help if I have to read.

Oh yes!  I forgot about this, but I've been wearing a spinner ring specifically for this purpose.  

> Taking notes keep me present mentally if I'm having to talk to someone. 

Another one I do but forgot to mention.  If I don't write it down, I won't remember, plus the act of note taking gives my brain something to do to keep it present and reasonably focused.  

> And lastly I have to listen to music while I do my data entry. 

Yessss, although this can go either way for me.  Sometimes music adds to my distraction.  Sometimes it helps minimize it. (score: 4) | Yes, same. It has to be specific music. I have a few different Playlist and have to find the right one for the days mood LOL (score: 2) | Do work in small chunks and take short breaks to refocus.  Use reminders and timers and alarms and notes.  

I use my calendar to schedule blocks of time to work on specific things.  I add reminders to emails so they don't get lost and drop off my radar.  

In between tasks, I get up and walk to the water cooler or make a cup of coffee or walk down the hall and back.  

&#x200B;

> I'm struggling to sit down and concentrate for longer time 

What do you consider a longer time? (score: 7) | I find that fidgeting, or increasing my stimuli helps a lot. I notice I lose focus a lot more if I'm feeling under stimulated, so I usually put on some music, or my favourite movie where I know the whole script for (it's Coraline) and it helps me focus. 

There's usually a sweet spot though. If I put on any new songs, I get too hyperfocused on the song, and if I put on a movie I don't know off by heart, I get distracted too. So you just need to find what your sweet spot of fidgeting and stimuli is, before you get too distracted. It's what has helped me at least since I'm unable to take meds for my ADHD (diagnosed combined subtype). (score: 4) | I‚Äôm confused. Do you have ADHD, and have been diagnosed or not? (score: 2) | I think they‚Äôre saying they are undiagnosed but have recognised the symptoms. And that they haven‚Äôt been diagnosed due the process being so long and idea of stimulant drugs being stinky (score: 1) | What kind of work do you do? That kinda affects what's is possible.

For me, good earbuds/headphones to block out chatter and put up some good music or podcast, the right fidget toy can be great to help focus, change of environment sometimes help to refocus (meeting room, lobby, etc instead of meeting room), body doubling is also great - if it's an office job then booking you and your colleagues time to work on a project together even if it's just sitting side by side and working, sitting at an angle where you don't see much coming and going, setting mini deadlines with your supervisor/manager is a great one. 

Im the end, you gotta remember you focus differently frm others. Sometimes it's about removing distractions, sometimes it's about  offloading brain energy (listening to music or fidgeting), and other times it's about a sense of someone is going to see (body doubling or mini deadlines). (score: 1) | Music. Can‚Äôt get through the day without it. Unless I‚Äôm taking a call or talking to someone I have one earbud in. 

Obligatory NAD/not medical advice. 
I had issue with stimulant type ADHD meds. There are some non-stimulant ADHD meds. I take Atomoxitine and it‚Äôs helped a lot. (Also looked at Guanfacine but it wasn‚Äôt covered by insurance) (score: 1) | I used to set up focus blocks. Make myself unavailable on calendar, set up my monitor by a window or wall so I wouldn't see anything in the background , use earplugs + sound canceling over ear earphones with white noise. Basically avoid letting any sight, sound or interruptions start as if I let a distraction start,  I know Im unlikely to get back in the zone. Though that was a coding job so not interacting for hours was acceptable. (score: 1) | Take notes, keep a calendar, and establish a routine. (score: 1) | 
It sounds like you're dealing with some challenging symptoms. Managing ADHD can be tough, especially with concerns about medication side effects. Here are some tips to help with focus:

Break tasks into smaller chunks: This can make them feel more manageable and less overwhelming.

Set timers: Work for short bursts of time, then take short breaks. Tools like the Pomodoro Technique can be helpful for this.

Create a distraction-free environment: Minimize external distractions as much as possible. Noise-canceling headphones or a quiet workspace can help.

Prioritize tasks: Focus on the most important tasks first to ensure they get done, even if your attention starts to wander later.

Exercise regularly: Physical activity can help improve focus and reduce restlessness.

Consider mindfulness techniques: Practices like meditation or yoga can help train your brain to focus and reduce impulsivity.

I also know some mental health apps that can benefit you:

Headspace: Offers guided meditation and mindfulness exercises to help improve focus and reduce stress.

MindShift: Designed to help manage anxiety, but includes tools and strategies that can also be useful for managing ADHD symptoms, such as relaxation exercises and cognitive restructuring.

Remember, it's important to find what works best for you, so don't hesitate to try different strategies and apps until you find the right fit. (score: 1) | Omg thank you for this advice. I think seeing it laid out this way has made it seem less daunting and less likely to fail somehow. I‚Äôve really been struggling to focus/concentrate in the more recent years due to what seems to be my OCD getting worse (why is it not getting easier pls). My brain is so full of repetitive and intrusive thoughts, including internalising my usually outward compulsive noises, that I‚Äôve been giving up on completing tasks; I‚Äôve been off work for a month now trying to get better! (score: 1) | Echoing what others said, definitely get tested & meds. I've tried a few, and so far extended release dextroamphetamines have been the most helpful. Otherwise, caffeine was a somewhat adequate substitute.

As for how to concentrate, that's the million dollar question! I think that ADHD is not really a ""deficit"" of attention, but rather too much attention or the inability to direct said attention to what we want. Reading a book a while ago, it talked about things being NICE, aka. novel, interesting, challenging, urgent. (yea, urgent doesn't fit), really help our focus.

If I dread doing something or have a hard time getting started, I found that I can do any of these things:

* Break down the task into smaller and smaller chunks. I don't have to do it, I just have to talk about what I'm going to do and how I would do it. It takes time, but eventually I am able to get down to small enough chunks that they no longer seem daunting and I can start.
* Meditate for 10-20 minutes. Often, I want to do a specific task, but other thoughts get in the way and take up a significant amount of mental power and I keep getting distracted by them. Meditating and blanking my mind really helps quiet those.
* Write down any thoughts that are going thru your head. Similar to meditation, but if you have ""to-do"" items or such, this is away to capture them, and temporarily put them aside so you can focus on what's in front of you.

Also, lately, I've been working with binaural beats on my headphones; search YouTube for ""binaural beats just tones"". While I do really enjoy music, it could be quite distracting! Alternatively, just play Crab Rave on loop; same concept heh. (score: 1) | I understand the worry about the liver, but not knowing if the drugs will work well isn't a good reason to not try them. If you get diagnosed, you could start at a low dose, get advice from a professional, they'll understand the hepatic risk.

162,1df0vd4,Okay so now I am starting to get concerned. ,"I have a habit of instilling fear on my own for the things I cannot get. Growing up, I was always adjusting to everyone and aside from food, clothes and school, I don't have anything. Basically, I don't have any priorities like my peers. About dressing up, favourite foods etc... This is actually messed up but because my dad has anxiety disorder and also have a specially abled brother, all the attention was onto them and i was just going through the flow. Since I desire something very rarely, the one I had in mind will be so intense that I can't even stop thinking about it. Just as simple as getting a new sandal, i can't get one because I have to convince my dad for it when he just thinks in a different way about it. I became an alien in my school because of how different was I am.  So from young, when it becomes clear that I am not getting whatever my classmates or friends get, I began to instill fear on my own to the things because I couldn't cope up. Now I am starting to realise that I haven't lived for my own happiness for a MOMENT ! 

My dad is always sick and won't leave bed (due to stress of course) and all I can do is waiting and waiting and when I get really sad about it, I just give up. Because if i fight over it, he won't get up for another 2 months coz my words hurt him.

So today I had a doctors appointment to re- go over some labs that had been ongoing on in attempts to get my hypothyroidism under control, as well as my high cholesterol. My doctor originally sent me a referral to a nutritionist, who I met up with to discuss a plan of action. I left the nutritionist appointment feeling highly discouraged and overall, checked out. During this appointment I discussed with the nutritionist that I would mainly like to focus on disordered eating, and focusing on eating more protein and getting into a better food routine. The nutritionist stated that disordered eating ""Was all in your head"" and then proceeded to focus on dieting to lose weight, which I told them, I wanted my interest to be on eating healthier, not losing weight. I told my primary doctor about this, and my concerns about having an eating disorder. She asked what eating disorder I had and told her I had binge eating disorder, and told her I was unable to work on it further because of the pandemic, and because I was recieving free therapy through my college, I was taken off the list because I was not actively suicidal. What I did not tell my doctor, was that I originally started seeing a therapist for high anxiety and depression, and that the topic of body dismorphia and eating disorders came up later, and briefly because the pandemic started in the following weeks. I was not formally diagnosed for anything, but my therapist and psychiatrist were pushing for depression and anxiety meds. In terms of having an eating disorder,  this is something I've been struggling with since I was 12 years old. Was I in the wrong for doing this? Am I faking an eating disorder?

168,1dexbn8,I miss high school so much that it‚Äôs making me depressed. ,"Throwaway bc I‚Äôm embarrassed.

I‚Äôve been out of high school for over a full year now. Coming up in august it‚Äôll be 2 years since i started my senior year.

For most of my school experience, I was in a small private school, up until my 8th grade year, when we switched to home schooling. We only did that for one year, as it wasn‚Äôt really for us. 

The year that followed, my freshman year, I was sent to public school. I didn‚Äôt really feel like i fit in there, and wasn‚Äôt sure what to do. Then, Covid happened. We were all stuck at home, which wasn‚Äôt too hard for me to handle. I spent my Sophomore year at home as well. 

My Junior year was different. I decided to enroll in a career-based school that puts you in classes depending on the job you wanted to do later in life. I decided to go into the graphic design path. There, I finally found my people. Everyone was friends, everyone was so nice. I have never felt so included and comfortable in my entire life. I met some amazing people, and made some amazing friends. That year is the absolute highlight for me. I even met a wonderful girl.

That girl and I started dating towards the end of the year, and that summer was spent hanging out with her and friends nearly daily. It was so perfect. I miss it so much. 

Later on that summer, things sort of fell apart a little. The girl and I broke up. That destroyed me. One of my best friends moved to Florida. That destroyed me too. I have never really fully recovered from that breakup I don‚Äôt think. I still think about her all the time, even though it‚Äôs been nearly 2 years. 

Senior year wasn‚Äôt as fun. I spent most of my time longing for her, hoping for a second chance. It almost happened too.. but it fell right through my fingers. 

Now, I‚Äôm almost 20, and I absolutely do not know how to get over this. I‚Äôm miserable.

I hope this helps or is at least semi-interesting.

I got into the whole manifestation train a few years back, and although I don't believe in it now I did gain one valuable skill from it; imagination. I mean the kind of extremely detailed intentional imagination, not an abstract fantacy. I use it to imagine, in detail (sounds, smells, sensations on my skin, buildings, weather etc.) what my life would look like if I didn't suffer so acutely with bipolar and ptsd. Who would I be? What would I sound like? What would my interests be? What kind of friends would I have? What would my apartment look like? What would my curtains look like? I mean in extreme detail, I have to be able to recall it as if it was a place I'd actually been. Sometimes I'll write it down or take a voice note if my brain is struggling to hold on to details, but usually the image and the emotions it conjures up is enough. 

I'm not a mental health professional so I can't explain exactly how this, frankly made up, image creates a sense of longing, but it does. This longing will usually stay with me for a while. Sometimes it'll make me sad (because it's not my reality) and sometimes it will make me angry (that I even have to imagine such a seemingly mundane existence). And in those feelings I'm able to process the pain I'm currently experiencing. It allows the feelings to come to the surface, and I can cry, I can write, I can stare at a wall and contemplate, it's different every time. But after a few days, the image will be almost like a memory (I'll obviously know I imagined this some days ago, and somehow (again, I'm not an expert), the image will become a kind of memory making it feel like something different than an imagination. Not quite a real memory, not quite a figment of my imagination. The feelings I feel when I think about it is real. The effort I took to conjure up the image is real, so the image becomes its own kind of not-real but still real thing. This feeling of attachment to the image will usually be enough to spark even a mustard seed of hope.

Not enough to suddenly be cured of depression, and not even enough to stop my unhealthy coping skills. But enough to want to believe that it \*can\* be real. Often times that desire for it to be real, will be enough to take tiny steps. A shower, a dish wash up, a reply to a friend or even searching up mental health professionals on TikTok to know I'm not loosing it. 

This was super long, and I'm sorry if it was useless. Thank you for reading, and excuse my spelling mistakes. Just thought I'd share in case it could be interesting/useful to someone. ",1,0,new,,

Couple that to having unsupervised internet access from as young as 5, and I was set to be an outcast. I had a few friends, but I would only see them out of school maybe once a year. Even then I ate alone during lunch because of food sensory issues.

I didn't go to any homecoming or prom events, because I just wanted to stay home and play video games. At the start of high school, I had an okay social life, had some friends I was somewhat close with. But reading through their instagram and seeing them go to Disneyland and the movies and all this awesome shit without inviting me made me feel left out. So out of anger I started making some threats to shoot up the school. After the police came to my house on Christmas Day while extended family was visiting, I was in a psych ward for 3 days.

After the visit I had to meet with the superintendent and ended up having to switch to smaller, more poorly run classes instead of the standard, more populous ones. I lost so many friends after that. I gave up. At least there was the hope of college being better.

[1/4]",1,3,new,"Then on my graduation year, COVID happened. Online classes means the rest of my senior year won't be as bad, but this better not affect my college year. During the summer, with nothing better to do, I rediscovered something that I had attempted numerous times in the past: making Youtube videos. That would become my brand new hobby for the next few years.


College starts. Classes are still online. But I still get to move into the dorms and meet 3 roommates. We introduce ourselves... and barely say a word to each other for the rest of our time there. In my 2nd year, one moved out in exchange for someone else who was cool at first, but then started inviting his friends from Arizona and getting drunk. They invited me to join, but cause I always prefered to isolate myself, I wanted no part. Which was of course a good thing in hindsight since they seemed quite trashy, but still shows that I'm too socially anxious to talk to anybody.¬†


¬†What about my classes? Well once they were back in person, I barely interacted with anyone unless it was for a project, even then, I usually contributed jack shit. College was supposed to be the funnest years of your life, staying up and having parties and shit. What happened? I managed to find a friend group via the college's app/Discord for a brief moment, we went to a Korean restaurant and saw the Batman together, but I spoke like at most 8 words total to the group when in person. I'm always the quiet one. [2/4] (score: 1) | Well, in 2023, I completed my transfer degree, and was able to have a fresh start at a new 4 year school... except it ended up being more of the same of me being an outcast and not connecting with anyone. This time though, I was in my own room not shared with anyone. Behind the scenes, I was still grinding my Youtube channel, which had gotten some decent traction from a video about the FNAF movie. I assumed that that meant I was set for stardom. So I did something really stupid: I stopped going to class for the first semester at the new school, and half the second. I lied to my parents telling them I was going when I wasn't

Big mistake. I made a few okay performing videos, but nothing that would warrant me dropping out of college. Midway through my 2nd semester, I was forced to meet with an advisor, and that's when I knew I couldn't keep up the facade anymore. Luckily my parents were forgiving. But unluckily, I missed so much that I had no chance of passing and had to withdraw from all classes for the remainder of the semester to avoid losing enrollment entirely. I was really hoping I could attend again and have a chance at socializing.

[3/4] (score: 1) | My next semester is July 8. I'm worried that because I missed 2 semesters, I will be behind people my age and not connect with anyone. Sure, people beyond 40 attend college sometimes, but how much do they struggle socially in there?

I wish I didn't live this life. My terminally online habits made it so Discord is my only way of communicating cause I'm so shy IRL. My only friends currently are online friends. My only hope is my Youtube channel, which is doing numbers right now, but even if I become a millionaire off it that won't change that I've never been normal, and never will be. But my brain wants me to isolate and play games and grind Youtube. But then at night, this is how I feel. Normal people live just such better lives than me.

My (F18) parents are always so attentive and helpful towards my younger sister and her mental health. Not too long ago, they told me that she had admitted to having a girlfriend. My parents are very religious people which led to them taking this issue very seriously. I won't go into detail regarding the whole ordeal but it was bad. My-sister-tried-to-run-away-from-home bad. My parents decided to bring her to a therapist due to this and other issues. From then on, my sister has been seeing a therapist very frequently. I don't like to boast but I do deem myself as a supportive person and I have been nothing but very helpful regarding the situation wuth my sister.

However, I've been facing a lot of issues for a long time and all l ever wanted was to seek proper help that isn't from a school counsellor who reduces my feelings to typical ""high school girl"" feelings. I just finished my final exam and graduated school which means that appointments won't bother my studying schedule. I wish I could put into words about my issues but l've always found it difficult. What's odd is that my parents acknowledge my severe anxiety and they never fail point it out - along with multiple other problems I face. They mentioned bringing me as they suspect I'm autistic but nothing has been done yet they constantly make jokes on my suspected autism which led me to believe they were simply joking all this while. I'm genuinely clueless and I physically can't bring myself to be vulnerable about this to them or ask them to take me to a psychiatrist. I don't know what to do.

I might've missed out on some things as I wrote on a whim while feeling distressed. Please give me a bit of guidance. I'd really appreciate it.

In early 2020, I left my now ex wife because I was totally miserable. I didn't go about it in the best way but with the benefit of hindsight, had I communicated more, it would have just prolonged the inevitable and we wouldn't have worked out. 

I became homeless and was taken in by a couple of friends. I ended up living with them for six months until I moved back in with my mum & dad. That was late 2020. 

In early 2021, the loneliness hit me and I became suicidal. I was living in a seaside town. There was one evening that was particularly stormy so I walked out to the sea front and stood there, seriously considering walking into the water. I ultimately decided not to go through with it because of the shadow it would cast over my nieces and nephew. 

Anyway, cut to 4 years later and I've met a woman I adore, who I'm engaged to. I've moved to Scotland to be with her, leaving my old life behind. I quit my job and found another up here. I can honestly say I've never been happier. 

I still think back to how I felt in those darkest moments. How hopeless it all was. And I can barely reconcile that feeling with the happiness and fulfilment I feel now. My point is that no matter how bleak it may feel, there can be light at the end of the tunnel.

https://www.attachmentproject.com/psychology/emotionally-immature-parents/adult-children/ (score: 2) | I also cannot even begin. But one thing that I literally cannot stop thinking about is when I was in highschool I was a track athlete. I broke my foot one year and had to not run that season. I gained maybe 5-10 pounds from not running. When I was good to go again, my mom (who was obese at the time) forced me to go to my highschool track in the summer and run laps while carrying a 20 pound kettlebell. When I was done she said ‚Äúthink about how much faster you could be if you weren‚Äôt holding onto that extra weight?‚Äù 

Shoutout to my mom for that. 
Anorexia has wrecked my mid 20s (score: 2) | Lots of yelling at each other, calling each other names, hearing them scream and slam doors and punch walls/doors when I was upstairs in my bedroom, threatening to divorce for 5 years (after 5 years I begged them to divorce lol), sometimes physical fighting, asking me to join their argument pushing me to pick a side.

My dad stabbing himself in his arm with a pen during an argument, where I was called in to pick a side in their argument (while I was already in bed as it was fucking past 11PM), is an image I cannot erase. My boyfriend was there, too.

My dad still lives in the house where all of this happened and there was a hole in the door which was a constant reminder. Luckily he repaired it eventually.

I currently live above a loud family where the mother yells a lot, the parents fight sometimes, and doors are being slammed, and it wildly triggers me sometimes. (score: 1) | Don't know where to start. There's way too much... (score: 1) | Self Inventory FOR LIFE. I was abused to a point that is not a public thing to talk about, the therapy is getting INTENSE. Once for 7 years straight the therapy I did ended, my therapist and myself decided we were good to go, that lasted me for YEARS! Then 4 more years and my new therapist said the same thing- I think you are ok, you have done great work. I agreed and felt great. Now? 13 years later I am working on the most intense, the deepest things that affected me. The walls I built have affected others. I just recently learned these walls pretty much left me looking self centered to others when my soul knew I was a great person. I simply never noticed the walls truly were affecting others. Now. This does not mean I have not encountered my fair share of folks that have no emotional empathy and cannot relate to one word I say. Others? The ones that understand and unconditionally love me, the love me and have seen me struggle but I never gave up‚Ä¶
What I mean is I HEAR YOU! I have affected my children yet I know it and I acknowledge this and I apologized. This cannot bring about thoughts that I am a bad mom, for the fact that I ve taught them to feel, I have broken generational traits and possibly our next generation won‚Äôt have it like I did, not a pity story just true. I have to tell myself, I know me, I know the efforts in put in and no one may ever notice yet this is who I am, I am deep, I have to communicate and resolve and some see that as self centered- when I have a problem trying to check in on everyone I love and they don‚Äôt see the passion I carry. Sometimes I feel like a bother , I know deep down I am kind and gentle yet if communication is not possible? I will not be able to understand anything about you. We must surround ourselves with folks that want to live the best life they can due to the fact that, 1, this is normal. Number 2, if I care about myself and my family I will continue to try. Sadly I ve lost relationships because of my need to communicate and resolve issues so I can move on and not leave things so open, I need to be able to resolve or I ll blame everything on myself. I unfortunately ended up loving dearly , a mate of mine yet they do not communicate. They do behind my back but all they can see is the bad unfortunate because I tried so hard and they blame me for every single thing that went wrong for 8 plus years. It is simply impossible to be someone s problem forever, there are others that have problems too. Yet they do not see it and that‚Äôs ok. For me? Problems I see I will try anything to fix but I cannot deal with large ego s nor can I have one write a 16 page letter after 2 yrs in a relationship in order to pls them and THEN they will act like they love me but until then‚Ä¶? I m to blame for life! No can do. Yet my problem with living others is I think they ll forever love me back. I do not mind apologizing. Yet I see that others may never or RARELY apologize because they know everything along with vengeance and head games. I gotta be real head games simply ruin me, I have no tolerance. So. I realized maybe I thought I liked folks that treated me like I was treated when I was young, subconsciously. So here s to therapy number three.
Sry to ramble but you asked! Ha! Thanks because you were and are my journal entry for today besides before bed!
ONELOVE TO ALL! God is love and love is god. It is OK to love ourselves and find the highest form of love we deserve. Usually the abused do not look for or at , their worth. A few people that live me and care to ask how I am. Like I said THE FEW! This is another reason I ask and care if one is OKAY! So I ask. Some gossip without reaching out and A FEW truly care! Always remember we are good enough for ourselves yah just gotta see it and do hangout with folks that communicate and do intense self inventory. Some? We will never please. Yet in reality all we need to be good enough for is ourselves. The right people will feel the goodness and see the beauty not just bad.
Excuse my rambling and or typos. I am speaking to my phone! HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAY- it is contagious and remember to spread love to the unknown for it is exactly what that word means- THE UNKNOWN. Love the unknown in all. The way I see it.
Plus? Yes, my childhood was TUFF beyond anything I could ever put on this post- 

WE ARE TRUE SURVIVORS. WARRIORS. The ones that never give up on love 

Peace (score: 1) | Nmother was constantly belittling as kid I remember I was 10 yo when she called me dumb loud and proud in front of my relatives. That went on til high school and til present time i‚Äôm already 27 and things never seemed to progress between us it was still the same she made me sure I was a failure in private and public idk if she has realized her ‚Äúmistake‚Äù or it‚Äôs already her decision imagine the many years that went by I was never able to please her. It affected my performance at school and at work. I wish I could just leave but I need money and a house to sleep on so I should just suck it up. I‚Äôm not going to lie, it still hurts and I feel sorry for the people around me (my friends) as my instrument to trauma dump I‚Äôm really grateful for their patience. 

Nmother usually see their daughters as some extension I guess that explains the belittling. Mother was dependent and she never succeeded in her studies she expects her daughter to be the same and that was I. 

No matter how hard I try, nmother made sure I was never good enough and she never failed to express it daily. I turned out to be anxious and depressed. Even after telling her I wanted to see a therapist she was still in denial. She was miserable. (score: 1) | Lots of violence and instability. Also the more I learn about head blows the more scared I get to be honest. I know mentally I‚Äôve been kinda scarred. Trust issues, communication, substance abuse, etc.. but I guess I always hoped it never could‚Äôve affected me physically .
Once when I was a kid I was hit so hard in the head that I was out for three days. Often I wonder if I‚Äôve had permanent brain trauma/damage. Idk. (score: 1) | My upbringing was rough and brutal...Recently, I was told by my psychologist that one of the problems I have  started back from my childhood when I was kid, which I have an explosive behaviour from time to time and it was the main reason I had lost my job. I undergone physical and psychological abuse for so many years, sexual abused, violence, threats and be controlled by my own father. My mother could have done something but she has never done anything to protect me and nobody has saved this child. I learned how to survive from those traumatic events since my childhood because I didn't have a choice. So, all I went through for so many years of torture. (score: 1) | Going to try to sum this up into a short response

But in HS I was a competitive gymnast, and I ended up hurting my ankle when I landed in the foam pit one night during practice. (& yes I literally got hurt with compressed foam blocks in the pit designed to prevent injury lol)

Anyways it ended up black and blue, so big I couldn't put a shoe on my foot, and extremely painful to walk on.

My parents and I had a strained relationship during this point in my life (my dad actually passed away shortly after this story while I was still in HS).

Well the next morning after practice I attempted to get myself up and ready for school, and my dad overheard me whimpering while trying to put my shoe on.

He yelled out to me "" knock it off you're going to school""
I assumed he thought I was trying to get out of going to school that day for whatever reason. 

He definitely never took one glance at it, but because he was an ""EMT"" for years in the past he said he knew what serious injuries looked like.. 

Fast forward to 2 years later, I joined the Marine Corps and was about halfway through Boot Camp when I had an xray done of my legs and they saw I had a non union fracture on the inside of my left ankle that had healed wrong. The tendon healed I between the fracture and they said it needed to be rebroken to have surgery done. I declined surgery because I didn't want to effecting my graduation date or boot camp training progesss. 

I to this day walk differently now because of it and it's a bit of a reminder of how a major injury of mine was ignored and not taken seriously when it needed to be addressed upon happening. 

I believe this effected how quickly I actually take myself to the doctor now when something is wrong or needing medical attention. I feel like when I'm actually injured it isn't serious or isn't worth being seen for. 

Being in the Marines as a young female didn't help much either because the mentality is to Suck it Up and Push Through, so it never got addressed. Just hardened my already traumatized mentality of when you're hurt, no one cares. 

I know that's not true now, but I still notice it had a life changing effect on how I handle my own medical issues. (score: 1) | I ended up developing anxiety, depression, and CPTSD. I can barely function now, just got a checking account, understood almost nothing they said. Working memory is shot, thinking and problem solving is shot, but im working on it with a therapist and psychiatrist. Still a nightmare.¬†
Still trying my best. (score: 1) | Read my entire page and that‚Äôll explain it (score: 1) | My mother never told me she loved me or hugged me, was always very emotionally neglectful. As a result I have very little capacity for empathy if any at all and I cannot connect with anyone on a level that would equate to love.

I do not love anyone, I don't know what it means to love anyone. I don't even love my family. (score: 1) | They're always fighting. (score: 1)",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dezxkm/how_did_your_parents_actions_leave_you_traumatized/

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him, I barely get a single second of peace in my mind. On weekends and breaks I feel alone. I look at pictures of him I find to make me feel better but I also feel extremely creepy. I feel ashamed.

I have no regrets, I am leading the best life possible now and I am on a schedule of meds, and I am so 'evened' out that there is never any catastrophising, yes there is worry, but that is sooned passed over for something else that catches my attention, I am now operating like normal folk do.

Adderall works way better, but much harder to get in my Country.

Unfortunately neither of these are available to me via my doctors because they don't really care here. (score: 2) | Personally, coming up on age 40 and receiving treatment since the year 2000, I‚Äôve taken about 22 psychiatric medications across classes, and only 1 produced a clinically significant and sustainable mood benefit. Unfortunately it also resulted in intolerable side effects making it unsustainable (by that I mean that the unrelenting vomiting for 8 consecutive months was so severe I started puking up the medication itself). That was SARI Trintellix (Vortioxetine), only available on brand. 

I‚Äôve also tried IV ketamine infusions, ECT, deep TMS, and am currently involved in a clinical study regarding Accelerated TMS targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 

So here‚Äôs my personal experience: I felt like I was drowning in the ocean. 

The IV ketamine knocked the ankle weights off and gave me a life jacket; it was easier to stay afloat. 

The ECT made me forget the rare fleeting fun excursions on a raft that I had experienced occasionally. I also lost some skills, so I could still clumsily tread water, but I didn‚Äôt remember how to breaststroke and had to relearn. 

The rTMS made no difference. 

The deep TMS removed my ankle weights at session 30/34; then my insurance denied extended treatment, and I was caught in the undertow and pulled under again. 

So far, one week post-treatment, the Accelerated TMS (targeting my medial dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) has produced a noticeable improvement; my ankle weights and weighted vest are off, but there‚Äôs no life jacket. 

Comparatively, the Trintellix (even with the vomiting) airlifted me out of the ocean and deposited me on dry land. It was incredible how much more energy I had for living once I was no longer expending all of it on surviving. (Medical providers had no explanation for my dramatic response; dramatically positive mood-wise, dramatically negative side-effect-wise. I was advised this was an unusual reaction, and not to expect similar results from medications.)

Currently I‚Äôm investigating trauma therapy. I have C-PTSD, and from what I‚Äôve recently learned, trauma has a huge impact on our brains and bodies. If you learned that you were helpless, misunderstood, unimportant, uncared for, bad, going to be punished, not good enough, etc, those experiences have been encoded in the deepest parts of your brain. The limbic system processes input milliseconds before the prefrontal cortex, so before you even have the chance to think about it, your body is reacting. 

Top down therapies like CBT are useful to some degree, but they didn‚Äôt change my somatic experience. Anything that reinforces the maladaptive beliefs I‚Äôve internalized due to my trauma is a trigger, and leave me feeling despairing. So I‚Äôm pursuing trauma therapies to rewrite that base code, to allow myself to experience the world different, as a place that has the opportunity to be reliable, safe, and rewarding instead of untrustworthy, unstable, and punishing. 

Some of those therapies are: EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) Therapy, PBSP (Pesso Boyden Sensorimotor Psychotherapy), and Neurofeedback. I highly recommend checking out Bessel van der Kolk‚Äôs landmark book on trauma: The Body Keeps the Score. (score: 2) | That's hard, have u ever look for a way with out medication and stuff?

To be clear, I am not speaking about situations or aspects where it would be 'normal' to care what other people think (in the sense that almost every human being would care).

Instead, I am speaking about situations where another person's opinion 'shouldn't' matter. E.g. if I have a hobby, I am afraid other people think I suck at it. Due to this, I am afraid to e.g. play an instrument in front of other people, because I am afraid they will judge me. If I imagine this judgement, I also ruminate about it and feel anxious / like a loser.

Another example: I don't get along with my coworkers so well and really don't like them (among others because they make racist and homophobic remarks, but also because we don't match in terms of age and lifestyle). Due to this, I keep to myself at work. Especially the nasty remarks make it feel 'unsafe' to self-disclose around them, as I have a history of being bullied. Still, despite the fact that I don't like them and also see them as pathetic, I still worry about their opinion a lot - e.g. that they think I am an awkward loser without social skills.

199,1dex354,I was molested by a family member,"Even before I started writing here today, I thought to myself, ""I must be a cornball type of guy"" just because I wanted to anonymously get something off my chest. There's a pattern like this, with all my thoughts, that I have been seeing a lot lately. 

  
I honestly don't know where to start with this post so I'm just gonna start at my earliest memories.

When I was around 5 years old, I stayed with an immediate family member. A whole lot of my family was there,  I could never name off everyone. This made things especially challenging after all these years, because instead of having 1 person I can cast blame on, I only have ambiguity. There were many, and multiple people, who hurt me as well as others.

I have this early memory of being with my Older brother, well call him BOOF. Boof and I were always so energetic and happy when we were young, jumping into pools n shit. One day, we were next to some shed on the same property where I remember my cousin performing sexual acts on both of us, while being guided by an adult. To this day, neither me nor boof can remember who this adult is. I suppose it is for the best, because getting away with murder doesn't sound ideal. Well, me and boof endured this and have talked only once in our lives about it. 

I reluctantly brought it up one time, about 5 or so years ago, and he just told me he swore it was a dream. He said theres no way it could've happened. After explaining I endured the same thing as well as saw him there, in the fucked up position, we both agreed to NOT talk about it ever again with anybody. 

Well today, I'm coming out. I did already tell my spouse. He is very supportive about it as well. Boof will not discuss it for a while I'm afraid, unless he told his gf behind closed doors. We are very similar in this way, so its very likely.

As grotesque as the memories are, theres a lot of weird twists and turns that come up when I reflect. Sure, I could get mad at my cousin, but it would be pointless. She was around the same age as me and was just following what fucked up instructions she had received from some fucked up relative. There was a court case that I recently learned about that involved my favorite uncle, but he was proven innocent somehow. All I have is pain, exhaustion, and questions which will never be answered.

Sorry if I'm rambling, its just that I heard if I share my story, the pain might start decreasing more.

204,1devtox,"I Do Everything For My Mental Health, But Still Depressed - Why?","Hi all,

For a good number of years now, I have struggled with continuous, albeit moderate, depression. Ever since a break up when I was 18 where I messed things up, that was the first time in my life when I felt properly depressed, and ever since then things just haven't quite been right, despite being completely over the situation and the girl in question (I'm 29 now).

My depression is not the kind that keeps me up all night crying or stops me from eating, but just a constant low mood that stops me from enjoying life or being excited at anything. I have ADHD as well, which doesn't help matters when it comes to motivation.

That being said, I do absolutely everything to help my mental health:

* I practise yoga
* eat healthily (vegetarian for 4 years, but supplement with B12, Iron, D, Omega 3, etc)
* avoid ultra processed foods (80-90% of my diet is natural foods)
* Take a probiotic daily
* run 50km a week
* gym 3 times a week
* avoid pornography
* healthy sex life
* Walks with my dog twice a day
* Reducing caffeine consumption to minimal amounts
* Counselling (this didn't help, however, because I had no trauma or 'bad thoughts' to discuss. I'm just low)
* Socialise with friends at my running club
* Journaling positivity and achievements of the day
* TDCS Headset Use - Day 6 so far

Doing all of the above and feeling hopeless about the future and my mental health is mind boggling to me, and it's really starting to get to me. God knows how I'd feel if I didn't do any of the above.

Thanks!",1,5,new,"I‚Äôm curious about the headset you mentioned. (score: 1) | It's a Flow Neuroscience one. Some great reviews. Currently on a 4 week rented trial with it at the moment. So far, however, no benefits for me yet. (score: 1) | What does it do? (score: 1) | Hard to explain, but it's essentially TDCS.

One of the things I learned to help me till I found the right med combination was learning to apply self compassion. It sounds selfish but it‚Äôs actually not. It‚Äôs self-care. There is a book by Kristen Neff on it and YouTube videos and meditations.  That helped me when I was beating myself up for not achieving what I wanted to. It takes the pressure off so you feel one less weight in life. 

The other thing is music and even singing the songs either via karaoke or by yourself or with a friend. Music can by music therapy. And it doesn‚Äôt have to be all happy songs. It helps you acknowledge how you feel and you also feel supported because someone out there in the world is singing what you feel. 

There is a list of cognitive distortions that may help you recognize the thoughts you‚Äôre having and ponder they aren‚Äôt true. Although I‚Äôm really good at some of them, so it‚Äôs continuous learning to watch my thoughts which are connected to my feelings. This is part of CBT that deals either feelings and thoughts. There is also DBT and ACT. 

There used to be also a list if you look up ‚Äúpersonal bill of rights ‚Äú that can be supportive thoughts to think about when you‚Äôre feeling not heard. 

Therapy can be more than trauma and bad thoughts. It can be support and being heard and learning skills. Just something to consider. But you don‚Äôt have to.

My parents have been working away for first 10 years of my life and I only got to see my mother for two months every year and but I did see my dad a bit more and I liked him growing up and absolutely despised my mother.

My dad retired from the force when I was 6 and I lived with him and my grandparents,  even though he was there he was an absent parent.

I am going to tie the knot soon and I feel like I will fuck up my marriage.

Being my parents not around, my uncles and aunties always put me down to make  me look like I am horrible sibling to my little brother and  a bad kid in the family. 

Even my dad was present in my life from the age of 6 he used to make fun of me Infront of his relatives to make them laugh and never defended me whereas his siblings protected and defended my cousins. I was almost everyones banter donkey and got hate for no reason.

Even writing this getting me teared up and my wedding is around the corner. I burst into tears everytime I get angry and can't control my emotions. My fianc√©e says it's fine but sometimes I feel like she thinks I am weak, for instance ""she asked me why are you getting emotional and crying"". As a man this hurt me a little as I felt like she's questioning my masculinity.

This pattern continued through puberty and into my adult life, affecting me both socially and professionally. As a result, my mental health has been suffering greatly, and I have often felt incredibly lonely.

I turned to social media hoping to find a sense of acceptance and belonging, thinking it would provide a great opportunity to socialize. However, I noticed that people I interacted with online would unfollow or unfriend me without any apparent reason. This made me realize that I will never be liked or accepted. This realization has had a horrible impact on my mental health.

The constant cycle of gaining and losing connections has left me feeling more vulnerable and less understood. It has become a painful reminder of the struggles I've faced all my life.",5,3,new,"I deactivated all social media accounts and deleted all the apps (FB, IG, X, Snap) off my device.

I‚Äôm going through the worst part of my life. My boyfriend who I have an extremely strong relationship with has decided to go into the military. His training is 8 months long, I got to see him 2 months in and then 4 months in, but now the last 4 I won‚Äôt see him at all. I can‚Äôt even speak to him because he‚Äôs not allowed his phone. I‚Äôve had severe attachment issues my whole life and have probably cried a total of imma say 100 hours over this. I used to have really bad panic attacks. 

Found out a few months after my boyfriend left that my only grandparent, that I‚Äôm close with suddenly has stage 4 lung cancer and has 3 months left to live. She was in remission and considered cancer free last summer and then bam. She‚Äôs going downhill so fast, they just put her on the oxygen mask and it‚Äôs terrifying. This is the first death I will have to deal with ever and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to get through it without my person with me. 

A few weeks ago I stopped being friends with my only friend because she hasn‚Äôt given me any support whatsoever in the past 4 months. I have to beg her to hangout with me even though she‚Äôs my literal next door neighbour. On top of that I work 50 hours a week and she works 15 and yet she can‚Äôt find time for me. 

I live with my two sisters, niece, and mom. My one sister which is my best friend works the opposite shift as me so we don‚Äôt see eachother at all, only on weekends. I get off late and when I get home everyone‚Äôs usually asleep or too tired to spend time with me. I‚Äôm constantly alone. I have no one to text, and can‚Äôt make friends that I feel comfortable with. I just hate people and always feel judged so I don‚Äôt like letting people in, I‚Äôve also never met anyone other than my partner that GENUINELY is interested in me as a person and deeply cares for me. I just miss him so much. 

And the cherry on top is how much I hate my fucking job but can‚Äôt leave it because I won‚Äôt get the kind of pay I do anywhere else. I work so far from home and am constantly gone, when I‚Äôm home I deprive myself of basic needs such as eating because I don‚Äôt want to waste my free time, I‚Äôm also chronically lazy. If I didn‚Äôt have to look presentable for work I‚Äôd probably shower once a week. I also rarely have an appetite and actually have a hard time eating in general because I‚Äôm always running on empty. I usually eat once every two days, I try to go for atleast once a day which is good for me but only if it‚Äôs a full meal, which it usually isn‚Äôt.

220,1detzc4,"How to process my failures, if these are really failures? ","Hi,

So my issues are very complex. Sometimes I can't decide if I'm a cool ""rockstar"", or a complete failure. Because we/I can see these situations in a very bright way as well. But I can see my life in the complete opposite way too. And sometimes I feel that it's a failure in reality, or at least not a really successful life. And I don't know what is the reality. And if its really a complete failure, then should I fix some stuff very quickly, because if not, something even worse would happen, or if everything is perfect in this way. So please help me see the situations more clearly.

**Studies:**

Positive:

During my university, I have achieved lot of awards, I had fame and glory, teachers praised me, I had invited to meetings with the leadership of the university, along with other 1-2 students, etc. I have received a national golden medal as well, in a competition.

Negative:

This was a pretty small university, it just entered a university state during my studies. And the other students were simply partying all time, and I focused on my studies double time, because I didn't do really anything else than learning and project works. So is it really considered as a big success?

**Career:**

Positive:

I have achieved a lot of my childhood dreams. I could do jobs, which I never thought I would really do. I know very few can even enter these kind of jobs remotely, and I could do remote works for places and companies I would never think I will. And I don't think I would starve at any time.

Negative:

During my whole 8 years of career, I was fired 3 times for low performance. It was shocking, I never saw these before, and I thought I did everything I could. I loved 2 jobs out of these 3. This is my biggest pain, because I felt some kind of success in my studies, and I thought my efforts will pay off. These happened while firing 1 other person as well in both places out of the 3. But still, I received that negative feedback in both places. Although I'm I really don't want to switch careers or learn something entirely different. And I feel its not arguable at all. I already thought about that, but I just can't switch. I know people who were never fired in their career. Why to be happy for a hardly-reachable job for many, if I lose that in a relatively short time?

**Relationships:**

Positive:

I had a happy 2 year long relationship without any arguments. I also had some shorter ones. All happened with some women I considered like top models, I loved them.

Negative:

The 2 year long could exist only because of the COVID. There wasn't any dating during that time, and when it finished, she just left me. And there's a woman, who literally hates me. I didn't know for a long time, how to react to some situations, and I tried to joke with sensitive topics, etc. I'm already over 30, and I had never have any wife or kids. I know people who could be in a relationship in their entire life. Then why to be happy about this?

So is it a success or a failure? Objectively, where can I be in my life? Am I progressing well? Am I behind most of the people? Is there anything, which is critically bad, and should be fixed ASAP, because later there will be some big issues I don't see now?",2,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1detzc4/how_to_process_my_failures_if_these_are_really/
221,1detc5f,Sudden loss of Spirituality? Do i need to worry? ,"Hi, so for context, i have been very spiritual for the past 5 or 6 years. It was a very important part of my everyday life. 
It became much extremer in the past few years. In the beginning i was just doing things like read tarot cards or throw together mahic spells. I actually became quite successful at predicting peoples future and was able to very accurately  and specifically tell people things about themselves i had no way of knowing, without the use of tarot cards. The spells i did oftentimes came true with very high accuracy. 
In the last 2-3 years that became even more extreme. I started sensing things and felt that i had supernatural powers. I ""sensed"" supernatural beings around me, i had a tree send me messages through my mind and lead me to a place through a pendulum that it had previously shown to me through my mind. I was sure there were two spirits watching over me that protected me. I believed that God's were watching over me and sending me signs. And while it may seem strange, these things never really interfered with my life, i didn't tell anyone but my friends about it. So i never thought twice about it. But now, that all just suddenly stopped. Like completely and i don't really believe in it anymore. My mental health was also quite bad during this time and it has improved (not really related to it stopping, more so, my mental health got better and i lost interest and believe in it). I don't know, maybe i really just lost interest in tbese things and moved on for now, but with how abruptly this all stopped i was honestly kind of wondering what was up with this and if i should be concerned about it.

",2,1,new,"Sounds like you have a bit of OCD with thinking things are in your peripherals, and you are constantly in flight or fight mode due to a lack of feeling safe and secure and relaxed. 

Mmmm you need to seek out ways to calm, self-soothing, and minimize your emotions. You need to find environments of safety, and wash yourself clean of stimulants like coffee, or stimulants like TV or movies or conversations or books that feel like they increase your arousal and delicate your sense of unease or excitement. 

I suggest also completely cutting out sugar and simple carbs as they have a poor effect on emotional regularity compared to complex carbs.

Deep breathing and meditation practices can help you. Deep breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system and causes a sensation of calming to wash over you after several minutes of it. Do it for 7 minutes and use a timer and a breath count of 5 second inhale, and 7 seconds exhale. 

Meditation helps you recognize and get acquainted with your monkey-mind. It‚Äôs the part of your mind that gets distracted and pulls your attention away from your present task. The trick to succeeding in meditation isn‚Äôt banishing the monkey from the mind, that is impossible. It‚Äôs to recognize when the monkey is getting distracted and reminding him gently and happily to return to your object of meditation. 

When you notice the monkey in your mind starting to chatter about something, that act of noticing is a win and a huge success in meditating, then you return to the focus whether it‚Äôs food, your breath, something your holding in your hands, the sounds of your environment like birds chirping, or the wind blowing. How this helps your specific problem is in the choosing of what you choose to engage in. 

If you perpetually choose to leave your fearful thoughts and engagements for the focus of the texture of an orange in your hands, its scent, weight, temperature.. then it will be easier to leave behind the thoughts and creat a new neural pathway to disregard the scary and instead when it happens to choose the option of simplicity and peace.

231,1dertqe,I feel like a person with good mental health who‚Äôs pretending to be a in a worse state then I am.,"Hey I‚Äôm a 15 yr old male who is trying to make sense of the way I‚Äôm feeling. I have never really used Reddit but I can‚Äôt find anything online to really explain the way I‚Äôm feeling and I guess I‚Äôm seeking someone who can relate or explain? To be honest I kinda feel like a good person who‚Äôs pretending to be worse than I am. For example I convinced my mom to allow me to see a therapist but I find myself feeling like I‚Äôm lying to my therapist for no reason. When I originally wanted to go to a therapist, it was because I was cutting myself. Thinking about this I start to wonder if I was just doing it for attention or I just wanted people to see that I was cutting myself. I feel like I‚Äôm pretending that I have stronger feelings than I do. The only way I can think of explaining this is kind of a numbness, but I tell people I‚Äôm feeling a way that I should be in that scenario. Like when my father went to rehab, I didn‚Äôt really care, weirdly enough. But when people asked me, I kind of broke down and cried about it but when I think about it, I don‚Äôt know why I did that when I honestly didn‚Äôt care I feel like I pretended like that was some thing that affected me very heavily. I guess to say that I have good mental health would be an overstatement in a way because I kind of just feel numb about most things. This kind of feels more like a rant because I can‚Äôt really fully explain what I‚Äôm feeling. Can anybody relate to this?

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/mentalhealth) if you have any questions or concerns.* (score: 1) | When I was around your age I felt simmilarly with similar fears that my emotions weren‚Äôt as deep as I felt they were. Sometimes I felt they weren‚Äôt deep enough either and that also bothered me. 

You‚Äôve got a lot of hormones at your age running around in you that makes it hard to feel consistent, this is okay.

I think I have some advice that will help you understand things about emotions a little better.

Firstly, emotions do what they want regardless of what you think they should do or what you desire them to do. Emotions are illogical, irrational, and they demand to be heard, seen, acknowledged, and expressed. 

So, figuring out healthy ways to expel the emotions and satisfy their needs so they aren‚Äôt running around in your heart longer than they need to be will improve your life incredibly. Also, learning how to quickly identify the emotions you are feeling will make expression of them in a mature way easier.

Secondly, therapy is extremely hard because you need to be emotionally honest and naked in front of another person in order to succeed and take steps towards a more enjoyable and fulfilling life. I recommend you read this post to your therapist. It‚Äôs a fact you were cutting yourself. It‚Äôs a fact you sometimes feel emotions, and it‚Äôs a fact you cried. Emotions themselves are incredibly confusing, and it‚Äôs completely and totally okay that you aren‚Äôt sure about them. It‚Äôs also okay to feel like a fraud. This is kinda part of the process you need to go through to be more skilled and emotionally intelligent with how you and others are feeling. The process is hard, and it is confusing, and your therapist (especially if you have a good therapist) will understand and be able to better assist you when you express your full concerns and truth about things. 

It‚Äôll be okay, and your therapist won‚Äôt abandon you, but they will likely understand your needs better and help you get more self aware and gain skills to help you with this specific concern. It‚Äôs not a comfortable or enjoyable concern, and therefore it‚Äôs one you‚Äôd like to change. I‚Äôm sure you want to feel like a genuine and content version of yourself, and you‚Äôll get there. Just keep trying and aiming to express little bits of true and honest vulnerability to your therapist at a time so you can gain trust and reliance that your therapist is capable of helping you. üòä (score: 1) | Wow to be honest I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to reply even though the reply button was right in front of my face but other then that I want to thank you for your kind words.

One day you opened up your eyes inside of you

Inside a world inside a universe you didn't get to choose

You didn't get to pick the rules or pick the past or set the pace

Or cast the cast and crew you didn't get to pick your starting place

And though it was a race you didn't understand

You simply lined up on the blocks and when the pistol popped you ran

And when you tripped and dropped you picked yourself up off the ground

And picked your scabs you knew you had to pick a plan to end what you began

As you got older there were days of cold surrender

Days of shrugged whatevers folded in with days of shocking splendor

But as time advanced the lovely days were covered up from view

By an advancing melancholy haze that hovered near the dew

Yet there were moments

There were these pure arresting moments when you stepped outside your head

Outside your pain outside control, outside the bullshit, out of body, out of rage

I'm not proud of it but despite me cutting them off, fhey still interact with me but it's one sided with them talking to me. I mostly ignore and give the silent treatment

It's been awhile now and I've never expressed my hurt and frustration to them, thinking they wouldn't care. Now I'm past the point of feeling embarrassed about reacting the way I am and now feel tired as well as remorseful for expending such hateful energy.

It comes down to me likely striking up conversation but is it do any good if I'm already thinking I don't want to be their friend anyway.

I shan't, can't, and won't control them, but I also wanna get them away from things that'll make it worse even if that just means them looking/interacting with things thag trigger them slightly less.

247,1deqsrz,Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è,"When I first joined this subreddit, my mental health was the lowest it‚Äôs ever been. I was struggling with anxiety attacks almost nightly and i spent my waking hours trying to ignore and push away my persistent depressive and suicidal thoughts. I was too scared to ask my parents if these feelings were normal things teenagers experienced so I came here for help.  

I only posted a couple times but the people that responded to my cries for help made me recognize that my feelings were not normal or healthy. Honestly, just receiving your validation made me feel like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I want to thank the people that responded to my posts because without you i don‚Äôt know if i would be in the place I am today.  I‚Äôm now seeing a therapist that is better equipped to handle my situation, i got on antidepressants, i am now way more open about my mental health with my friends and family, and i feel more comfortable around people in general. From the bottom of my heart i am grateful. You helped me realize that I wasn‚Äôt alone‚ù§Ô∏è

To anyone currently struggling, never be afraid to ask for help. There will always be someone willing to listen.

You can respond to someone‚Äôs post about how they want to off themself and decide to tell them they‚Äôre a horrible human being for putting other people through that. 

You can judge someone for using Reddit or the internet as a source of help. 

You can make the conscious decision to bully someone who is at rock bottom. 

It‚Äôs so incredibly easy being mean to people you don‚Äôt know. You‚Äôll never learn their name, you‚Äôll never see them in person. You‚Äôll never feel the guilt or see their face when they read your disgusting message. 

Like I said, there‚Äôs zero repercussions. 

I‚Äôll still never be able to understand why people do it. Why trolls are a thing. Why people find gratification in doing these things. 

We learn to ignore the ‚Äúinternet trolls,‚Äù or we hear ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let them get to you,‚Äù as a response. But we continue to allow it to happen.

Bullying on the internet has caused a lot of issues. 

It‚Äôs one of the most disgusting things on the planet in my opinion.

257,1defsjw,"Without adderall, it feels like my brain won't turn on and function (prescribed for TRD, fatigue, sleep apnea)","Long story short... I have battled major depression/anxiety for over half of my life. I am 32 now. These last 4 years have been the most difficult years of my life. COVID hit (living in LA, CA so it was the worst), and then immediately I lost my Dad tragically and unexpectedly. He was everything to me. Then I lost my Aunt (basically 2nd mother) a few months later. My world was turned upside down. I tried to continue working a stressful job at an AI startup that I helped co-found but had to resign. Then I had a horrible snowboard accident, 2 damaged discs, a herniated/pinched nerve, and a severe blow to the sacrum/pelvis. Doctors during covid wouldn't do imaging so I didn't find this out until a year or more later. Then I reinjured my penis. My meatus (penis hole) has been slowly tearing over the years. It ripped significantly more. Went to doctor after doctor. No one said there was a fix to repair my penis.

I fell further and further into a deep, dark depression, mainly brought on by grieving but the chronic intense pain and no relief or answers made my spiral. In the past, psych meds had never worked well. For a bit then stopped or made things worse. I did intensive therapy, ECT treatment, TMS, and Ketamine, and even tried other meds out of desperation. Then I was prescribed Adderall off-label for TRD. It worked. It helped with the pain, put away suicidal thoughts, I could function, get back into treatment, and make music, wow! I'm not new to stimulants, meaning I've witnessed my brother with ADD go down that path of trying different ones. I didn't think I had ADD, maybe idk, but severe depression makes you feel like you do have it. Now, as some may know. Adderall wears off. There is a crash. Since I was depressed, the crash was unpleasant. More intense SI, anger, irritability. I've been on and off it for the past 2 years. I've gone lower and lower with some ups and feeling hopeful.

I notice now that when I wake up, it's almost like my brain is just off. I'm so slow. Hard to do basic things. It's hard to process, communicate, remember, and do the things that I need to continue doing to get healthy. Like treatment, exercise, preparing for upcoming urological surgery, being in the community, also preparing to go back to work, etc. basic life. I know I am rambling but it is such a love/hate relationship with this drug. I've tried and tried without it even for long periods do everything that would or can heal my mind, promote neurogenesis, and help me feel ""normal"" like it even works. I have Adderall xr 10mg and boom, I can function.

Is anyone else experiencing this or has it in the past? I'm trying to find natural remedies that mimic what the stimulants are doing to my brain. I'm also tapering off of Cymbalta slowly, I take gabapentin 3x a day, I have Xanax XR, and Xanax IR as needed, and tapering down on Seroquel for sleep. My goal is to slowly get off all meds but I feel like I need something else to add a buffer to negate the side effects/balance out my confused brain with all of the neurotransmitters. I'm not addicted to Adderall, will use it when I HAVE to be on, or I know will help in situations so I can function and not be a catatonic zombie.

Any feedback, ideas, thoughts, etc. - I am new to posting on Reddit but figured I would because I tend to find others that I can relate with.

My now ex deals with stuff too, but he copes by getting drunk and high on the weekends. I always knew we would break up since he was usually emotionally unavailable and I was insecure. To be fair we lasted 5 months longer than I thought we would.
He‚Äôs been with a lot of people, but he was my first real boyfriend. He is genuinely the funniest person I‚Äôve ever met and really brought me out of my shell.

The last couples weeks were bad. I felt bad for him since I felt like I was suffocating him with my baggage, while he felt bad for me since he couldn‚Äôt give me the attention that I wanted.
The last day we spend together as a couple was fun since we just spent hours hanging out and laughing which was a nice change. I asked him later if he actually wanted to break up since we were thinking about it for a bit. He said that he felt neutral about it and said he‚Äôs pretty indecisive (which hurt since it made me feel like he didn‚Äôt really care about our relationship). I told him how much I liked him and how I didn‚Äôt want to break up, but that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm mentally stable enough to be in a relationship.
We decided to flip a coin, best of 3. Heads means break up, tails means stay together. 3 HEADS IN A ROW!!! We just started laughing, but I was dying inside.

I attended his funeral and did the last rights. Ever since,i been visiting and talking to my biological mother but not frequently. I have a younger sister and younger brother from my biological parents, but we are not in good terms.The relationship soured when during their younger days, i found out that instead studying, my sister was going out with a guyi scolded her for this and promised to get her married and told her not to take any wrong decisions and instead to concentrate on her studies. she got pregnant and eloped with the guy, and came back and the guy ditched her and married another lady. She delivered the baby and my biological parents raised her kid. Now she is remarried. My younger brother dropped off school and the relationship with me soured when i scolded him for his drinking behaviours and for dropping off school. and now he is working for meager wages and heard that he is financially struggling. 
My biological mother asked me to support her financially as my brother and sister are struggling financially and later i found out that they are pressuring my mother to get money from me in pretense of expenses for my mother. I give her some cash whenever i visit as i felt too tired with all that going on.

In all this turbulence, one person who stayed true and strong with me, took me up when im down and broken was my wife.
They say that god doesn't give you what you like but what you need the most in your life. He gave her to me and i treasure her. I at times feel bad for being very emotional and treating her badly in the past during the dark phases of our life. She worked part time to support me when im was jobless for a year, ate one time so i could buy clothes for new job. At times, thinking back what she have done for me, my eyes get wet. I dont know what i did in my life to deserve her because all those around me and my wife, they were all fake peoples. Her parents stopped talking to her when she started financing her studies independently and didn't even attended our wedding.Its been 7 years they left her like that. 
But its always amazing how she always talks about how amazing i am, how i supported her during her hard and dark phase.
Im sharing these here as i wanted to get these off from my heart. I will be joining a new job, and mentally exhausted, felt worried if i could succeed in the new job, and we both planned to try for a baby, and worried how im going to raise the kid with my emotional damages.

She also worked part time and due to the high education fee in my country, our educational loan wasnst sufficient enough hence we borrowed from banks. we both graduated and tried to pay off the debts. In between, both of us was jobless for a year due to company down sizing and couldn't service the loans properly, and was almost had my car repossed. Changed few jobs for higher pays, sustained toxic bosses and now still paying off the debts, but good thing is we have managed to pay off large chunks of debts owed to banks and family members.

During this period, financial constraints and family members toxic emotions took a toll on us. both of us suffered mental pain and had frequent fights.

273,1deoc8a,Help with a Son,"Trying to make a long story short‚Ä¶

Son, 24, mental break about 4 weeks ago. Involuntary commitment for past 10 days. Coming home tomorrow. Refuses professional help. So I‚Äôm all he got. Help. How do I set him set himself right? Get him thinking clearly? Give him something to live for?

I have many ideas about the root issues.

But I think I need to get him to see one OR figure out how to live with all the issues.

He‚Äôs angry. He‚Äôs parinoid. He doesn‚Äôt know what his purpose is. He desperately wants to be something. 

But I think he wants to figure it out but he don‚Äôt know how, or wont try.

My question: are there activities that I can give him to figure it out on his own?

Gonna start with asking him to plan his next day in 2hr blocks. Up at 8, bed by 10, sleep by 12.

Giving him small things to do, like cook 2 meals a day. Walk the dogs for an hour, plant a garden.

I think making him journal is key. But he fears some reading it. Gonna make him write a page and burn it the next night. *shrug* Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôll work.

We could make this about me but I‚Äôd rather not‚Ä¶but we can‚Ä¶just be polite.

More details that you could skip:



6 out of 10 on the ADHD scale.

Gamer since 6yrs old. Was his escape place.

High internet consumption from 10 to 19. More hours on the net than sleep. All the things you see about online kids. He did it.

Highly intelligent.

Father had no clue.

Involuntary admission for Psyc issues. (Ummm, the health care system sucks‚Ä¶but they did the best they could, but yeah, I would only advise that route out of desperation)

",1,1,new,"Not sure if it‚Äôs depression he‚Äôs dealing with or if he had a psychotic break but here are some other things. I would do my best to keep him engaged in activities and on a schedule.

Would he be willing to take walks in nature or even just around your neighborhood? Lots of time for him to think about his purpose and being in nature is supposed to be therapeutic.

How about learning meditation, mindfulness or grounding exercises? These are often taught by therapists but can easily be found on the internet.

Does he like music? He could make a playlist or even a new playlist if he already has one.

Don‚Äôt laugh but there are coloring books intended for adults. Sometimes mindless activities are relaxing.

Would he like putting a puzzle together? 

There are a lot of self help, interactive books on Amazon.

I wish you the best of luck. If you can, keep gently encouraging him to see a therapist but don‚Äôt annoy him too much with it. (score: 1)",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1deoc8a/help_with_a_son/

Some people find it easier to seem happy or not troubled than being open. But that can lead to not getting the true treatment you deserve to help you. It's scary, trust me. That's why I mentioned decades that it took me to open up.

I live alone, and I have no support system (no friends, no family). I am really starting to struggle I am almost constantly experiencing some type of mental distress. Weather its anxiety, intense worry and dread, deep sadness or compulsive behaviors. I am exhausted, and living like this is really killing me, I just cant take it anymore. Going to therapy once a week just is not cutting it for me anymore. I really feel like I need something more than a 50 minute session once a week. But I don't know what to do.

But I cant afford to take any time off. I barely get by as it is. If I take time off work for it I will not be able to pay my bills and rent. I just have no idea what to do.   
Anyone have suggestions of what type of extra mental health help I could use? And how do I get help while still maintaining bills and rent?",8,5,new,"Hi üëã 

This sounds like me just over a year ago. Pretty much word for word.

I went manic and went to hospital for it. I had a dog, I live alone, no support, no family, no friends, just my job and trying to stay afloat with bills.

My struggles were bad and I had a coworker take me to hospital in my darkest time. Looking back, yeah it was crappy feeling, but I realized I had to do this for myself to be better. Sadly, I rehomed my dog. It hurts still, but it was best for not only me but for him, too. If I couldn't take care of myself properly, how could I take care of him?

The bills, yeah, still dealing. But it's not the end of things. I'm not sure if your job allows time off like leave of absence or anything. Mine has and even that was a mess because of how some LOA places don't recognize mental health. But you know what? I'll burden those bills and eventually get them taken care of as I get better. I'm still working on that. 

After hospital, I did an outpatient program for 2 weeks for CBT. That was eye opening while learning all these new skills. Then I found therapists for what I've gone through. There's therapists trained for specialties, do research. It does help. I've also gone TMS and Ketamine therapy since. Payment plans, because my mental health and well-being is more important than money or anything else. I'm making up for that, even if it takes time.

It's up to you when you're ready to take additional steps to work on yourself to be better. Listen, embrace recommendations, research them for your comfort, don't be afraid to ask questions.

I hope you have a positive journey and know that you're really not alone. It's hard not having support but I'd suggest looking into community resources if you feel comfortable. For me, my therapists and psychiatrist have been my support. If it weren't for them, I don't think I'd be here or anywhere near feeling better and growing, realizing life and opening up to them honestly.

i know they take a few weeks to ‚Äúkick in‚Äù but they‚Äôre literally not doing anything other than making me yawn every 5 seconds and want to vomit all the rest of the time üíÄ.  being increased to 10mg 2x a day next week and i beg that these symptoms subside sooner rather than later.

I've tried so many in my life, I've estimated I've tried about 90% of what they prescribe for those in my mental health area. Tell your doctor how you feel and that it's just not good for you. They can suggest others. Some have more side effects on lower dosages. Example of mine, Mitrazipine, that made my body collapse less than an hour after taking on low dose. I had slept on the floor a few nights because I didn't make it to bed. I'm alone in my struggles, too. So that wasn't fun.

Make sure to notate and keep a record of this in case you change doctors. You can also get a history of any meds provided from your pharmacy if you need to go back a couple years.

I'm glad your SH has subsided a bit. But you can work on that with not only medication but also therapy. Having both helps, in my case. It may be something additional to look into if you're not already seeing one and being honest with them.

But please, make sure to notate and advise your psychiatrist about your medications and side effects. It's important to make sure they don't try them again when they haven't worked.

289,1deln0l,I messed up. ,"So, quick rundown first. The last month has been extremely rough on me.(21 M)

I lost my job, got dumped, and blew the transmission in my faithful old truck, all in the same day. I couldn't get any help with my truck, couldn't afford a shop, so I called my deadbeat father that I have spoken to 4 times in the last 15 years. He showed up, helped me drop my transmission, found out it would cost too much to rebuild, and he just up and left. Haven't heard from him since.

Now to the me part. Last Thursday, I did a bit of binge drinking, thinking it would help me out with my depression. Needless to say, it did not. I ended up sobbing in my truck with a [redacted] to my head. My best friend in the whole world managed to make me see sense, and brought me back. I've really come to depend on her. We talk all day every day. She is the best person I know. 

Then, on Saturday evening, I got a major nosebleed that lasted 3 hours straight and ended with me in the ER because I lost 2 pints of blood. Obviously that made me extremely woozy. The blood loss, coupled with the anxiety and depression, and a bit more alcohol because I didn't learn my lesson, lead me to a full mental breakdown Monday evening. And of course, I panicked and directed all my pent up emotions at my best friend. She hadn't been responding at all that day, and my abandonment issues due to aforementioned father lead me in a downward spiral of overthinking where I thought I was losing her too. So I lashed out. And it was bad. 

I haven't heard from her since. And that really hurts. Because the two of us have similar mental issues, and we've become kinda codependent. So losing her has just torn a part of me out. I hope I can recover. I hope I didn't drive a wedge between us permanently.

And of course, I have made my first appointment with a therapist. 

I'm sorry about the vent post, but other than her, I have nobody to talk to about this, and I guess I came here to see if anybody had some advice for me about any of this. Feel free to ask questions. I appreciate any input yall may have.",2,1,new,"**Hello u/!**

im trying my best, even though it seems like im doing nothing, this nothing means a lot to me. my family is not understanding my situation, my friends are not and even my boyfriend doesn't. he makes studying sounds so easy and that i could finish studying real quick which made me so angry because i told him about my struggles with studying and how i failed multiple times because of that. i told him ""this wouldn't be a problem for normal people. it won't work in my case"", he replied with ""you make it sounds like there's something wrong with you"", i replied with ""if there's something stopping you from functioning like a normal student and making you fail then there's definitely an issue"". the rest of the conversation was awkward. the only person that finally understands me is my best friend and she's encouraging me to seek therapy after my exams.

Having people in our circle of support is helpful. Therapy is a great thing to try. Being open and honest with your struggles helps them with tools to provide you to use in your every day life. Trying to standardize being ""normal"" is kind of off... I say this because everyone is different. What someone may see as normal may be abnormal. What you're seeing may seem abnormal, but we're all different flavors of life.

Working on your next steps of healing is good, and even taking baby steps like reading a chapter for school, taking a walk outside, brushing your teeth, having a meal, one thing at a time. Some people need smaller steps to help them get to bigger steps. And that's okay. You're going through stressors that some people don't get. Let them do them and you do you. If they're not supporting you, then it may need a talking or put them to the side for a while as you figure out yourself. Some people don't like being selfish and thinking of themselves. Be selfish, this is your life. Do what you think is best. Talk to those that your feel comfort with, and reach out to professionals to help your in your journey. This is your life. Make it the way you want it, even with baby steps. 

Yes, it will feel like ages, but you'll soon discover that it's going to come full circle. It may not be right away, but it will come.

I wish you the best and know that even if you feel nobody understands you, there are so many out there that feel similar (like me) but many don't express it. Work on your goals for life but also self care for yourself. You matter and you should be heard. Take the step to therapy if you feel it is right. Be honest when you go. You've got this.

My life seems to be a series of shorts intense highs and lows without any middle ground.

292,1delb8v,Why is work so stressful?,"I am fine up until I sit at my cubicle. It feels like there is a heaviness surrounding it. I‚Äôm not getting sales but people do talk to me. Idk if I need to call a priest to bless my seat but every time I take lunch or leave for the day, I cry out my frustrations. There is a mix of other things that make me cry outside of work. 

I‚Äôll feel better after crying but the minute I sit down, I get brain fog and fatigue. I don‚Äôt know if the seat has a bad vibe because of the last girl who sat there (she had anger issues). I just feel dead. I‚Äôm gonna move seats tomorrow to see if that changes things. 

I‚Äôm also starting trauma therapy EMDR so I feel so sad thinking of a lot of my issues. 

I get flustered at jobs that I can‚Äôt grasp right away. It could be food service or sales, if I‚Äôm not doing great at my job it really takes a damper on me. 

But what do I do to cope with my stressful job until I get a new position or turn my sales around?
",1,1,new,"Hi there! 

Sales is a stressful job. I see it, I'm not in it, but my job coincides with sales and how much work they put in. If you feel uncomfortable in that cube, ask for another or ask for a shared space if you're comfortable and it's available. Work can totally be stressful with the deal, the paperwork, the communication, the keeping up with meetings, all the 'fun' that comes with it. Maybe bring some ingredients with you to work that makes you comfortable.

I've seen other sales people bring in a plant, a small men garden, photos of loved ones, words of encouragement, a whole bunch of things. Everyone works their deals in their ways, but know that you've got a tough job as it is to sell. Having that kind of knowledge and rapport takes time to accumulate and be good at. Even comfortable with the product(s).

I saw EMDR in your post. I'm currently in it, almost a year, and it has helped out so much. Since I've been in my industry for a couple decades, EMDR has helped me with the trauma of work (along with past stuff) and helped give me tools to work around these negative thoughts. I was put in an office that I thought I should have had 5 years ago in another position because I was already doing it, just not in name. It was so freaking hard being in that office knowing that I'm in a completely different position but now it was my office. I went back and forth putting up things for comfort. Eventually, I was able to put up a couple awards I received. EMDR therapist encouraged me to not make it the job I ""should"" have in the past, but the job I worked to get into now.

I know it's a tough road and I empathize since I talk with sales people daily for my job, and I listen, I get it, and I let them know that we're a team and will get through it. In my industry, sales and service are like oil and water. I've been years breaking that bridge and have worked on it in my large Corp org, with the support from my therapists (EMDR and other).

It will take time to figure it out, but you'll figure it out. Don't think of the past person there, that's not their seat. That is yours and you control it. That is your spot (unless you want to move) and take it by the horns. You've got your quotas and things to attain. Focus on those. Positivity is huge in that area. I always give encouragement to our sales people. They help us keep the lights on. In return, they appreciate the support and work along side and can vent their frustration. Sometimes I suggest to others why not work in a coffee shop half the day to get out and not have the internal interruptions. Be out and meet clients (if that's your part of sales) and cold call or show up to places.

That cubicle is temporary. It's just a spot for you to plant your seed while you're out there growing.

But I am glad to hear of someone else doing EMDR to help with past trauma. That also helps with furthering your journey to overcome more than the past, but also your future.

I wish you the best going forward. You can do this, no matter what seat you're in. It's your time, the present. (score: 2)",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1delb8v/why_is_work_so_stressful/

I‚Äôm now 14 years into a successful career in the wine industry and have decided to push myself by going for this certification. I‚Äôve never know how to study and have only recently started figuring out what works for me. 

Today was my 2nd of 5 exams for this certification and I absolutely fucking melted down this morning before the exam. For the last 10ish days, I‚Äôve found that studying has been even more difficult for me. I read a passage in the book and review flash cards but no matter how many times I review I could not get a lot of things to stick. My brain just seemed to be blocking me from inputting new information. I‚Äôd reread the passage again, then close my eyes and ask myself the question. Every single time, I could remember 3/4 things and I could visualize the text but the part I couldn‚Äôt remember was just blank in my mind. After rereading the same passage 3 times this morning and realizing it wasn‚Äôt sticking with 2.5 hours to go before the exam, I just went into a full on panic attack. Thankfully my wife was home and she just remained calm and listened to me cry and talk and after a 30 minute walk I calmed down enough to go take my exam.

Secondly, and please do not take this as minimizing your feelings, but this sort of feeling as a teenager is incredibly normal and common.

My three teens have all felt it and often do. Do not feel any guilt or shame for struggling. There are people who want to help. 

You are at an age where you have not figured yourself out entirely. Your brain has not finished forming. My dad likened growing up as ‚Äúa soul being poured into a skin suit and trying to fill it out and feel it out, and man is it confusing and uncomfortable and sometimes downright scary.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt wrong. Your brain is hardwired right now to look at yourself, realize how different you are from others, and wrestle with what that means. It can be a scary, confusing, and lonely experience. It takes a long time to figure it out, and your brain is uncomfortable the whole time. 

What I can tell you is that depression is sometimes chemical, sometimes environmental, but usually both. There are things we can do on both the medical, behavioral, and environmental front to experiment with what makes us tick - what gets those happy hormones going? We can train our brain - program it like a computer - to have certain reactions and responses. We can chemically shift when necessary, and the solutions to the complex mental health issues we face get better all the time. There is no magic here and not everything works for everyone. You must be willing to try some things out. But there are things that can help. 

It sounds like you are suffering from a lack of meaningful connection, as well as being able to really know and enjoy yourself. Is therapy an option for you? I don‚Äôt know your situation, but Have you expressed to your parents that you would like to talk to someone or see a doctor? Both would be an excellent place to start.

After that, if you are open to trying to find what makes you happy, as I hope you are, I hope that you start to try and experiment and learn. Connection is something that can be learned. It‚Äôs hard right now, I know. But I have faith you will find your people and what drives you.

I didn‚Äôt live through this exact scenario, but I do understand what it‚Äôs like to have a family that makes you feel invisible.

Okay so, moving out is not an option. Definitely save up as much as you can, and maybe even start looking for a part-time job. Unfortunately, the only real way to get away from this is to set yourself up for success.

Start telling yourself that you are strong and you are on this journey to a fulfilling life with or without your family being apart of it because it is your life that you are in control of now and you have a say in what happens next. You are going to be your own best friend. Use this as fuel to start your own life.

One day, not too far off, you‚Äôll be established and have more of a say in how you spend your days, and with whom. Feeling unaccepted by family sucks, but try to remember it‚Äôs not a reflection of who you are in your soul. Try something that makes you feel happy or excited or calm every day. Maybe it‚Äôs a journal, yoga, a run, painting, an instrument, or the gym. Maybe it‚Äôs none of those things. Listen to a new podcast or audiobook. Take a nice bath.

1. Spoke to my psychiatrist and started on Effexor for my depression and anxiety 

2. Had an honest conversation with my boss (granted I know this isn‚Äôt always feasible but I‚Äôm lucky to have a boss I can be transparent with)

3. Make a list in the morning of what absolutely has to be done today - and by that I mean the bare minimum requirements (Once I get one or two tasks done it increases my productivity/mental state)

4. Forgiving myself for mistakes and knowing that I am already taking steps in the right direction to get my mental health under control/manageable state

Your life is nowhere near over! Make a simple list of some achievable goals and how you plan to work towards them. You got that job, so you are capable of getting another. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up and throw yourself into a panic (easier said than done I know).

He used to keep me and my brother(now 12M) in the car for hours at a time do he could drive and vent to us about how much he hated my mom and how much he hated me specifically for not doing anything to help him.at first when it happened i was confused and sad but now i just tune out when he does it because hes just angry and i know he doesnt actually hate me,it just sounds like a broken record now.

He always denies being violent but they always were violent ,but one of the things he would blame me about and yell at me over is one time that they were fighting and it got really bad and he chokeslamed her into the wall and broke it,i was like 8-9 and when he left to his room i went to my mom and said she needed to leave him and he told me he overheard this and its always made him tense with me and untrusting to me. 

 there is one thing he told me and my brother that just recently has been making me so anxious and guilty. I didnt have an idea of what rape was when he told me this but now that i do its been eating at me. He told us once that he had to ‚Äúforce my mother to have us‚Äù and that she never wanted us in the first place.

 I feel disgusting thinking of this and so guilty i havent been able to even look at my self for a month now and i avoid wearing my glasses or contacts i cant describe how it feels.i feel so disgusted with myself because i think it means i wasnt even born normaly and lovingly i was born from him being violent.I used to just tell myself that maybe he meant she wasnt allowed to abort but my mom is quite religous and doesnt belive jn abortions in the first place. My mom used to tell us she was in college for political science and i love hearing her stories of her before us but now it makes me feel disgusting because the only reason she gsve it all up was because i was born and i literally took everything from her. And i feel extra guilty because i still miss my dad and i love him even though i find him disgusting and i dont like it when he touches me, im old enough to not visit but i still do voluntarily.

What did he mean by that? Am i wrong to still love him?

Literally every second of every day I'm trying to get rid of these intrusive thoughts by thinking positively but it only works like half of the time. These bastards that I hate won't get out of my head. I am sometimes in physical pain from punching and slapping myself because of these thoughts. I can't do anything. When I'm trying to do something I have to be thinking of positive people/words and if something negative comes into my head, I have to stop or start over.

I'm also incredibly indecisive, because I am so desperate not to end up regretting what I do. Which is normally what ends up happening. I keep thinking inanimate objects have feelings aswell. All these problems and these regrets I have in my life have been making me feel absolutely dreadful. I'm purposely isolating myself everyday and all I want to do is sit around playing video games all day on my own because I'm literally unable to do anything else. I've been feeling like ending my life lately.  I went to a doctor recently and the doctor said I have OCD.

Since you‚Äôre actually feeling scared at this point, keep this from them up until you‚Äôre ready to move even to moving day if possible so they don‚Äôt try to guilt you into staying. 

Anyways, this is just my opinion. I‚Äôm not an expert by all means. This is just what I‚Äôve experienced and what I‚Äôve seen other people experience. (score: 2) | Also I would like to point out that it is not your responsibility to make sure this persons mental health is on track. You can help of course, but if this person is still having these outbursts because of this and that then did they really listen to anything you were trying to tell them? Because I feel like if they were, they would be trying their best to not have these episodes around you at least and would instead reflect on WHY they are dealing with this. Yes they‚Äôre hurting, but you can only help so much up to a point. (score: 2) | It really helped a lot just reading your reply, I really appreciate it

I think you need to try and find a new therapist, which I know isn‚Äôt easy, but having a therapist you hate is probably making things worse rather than better. It‚Äôs so important to feel comfortable with your therapist, and you‚Äôve been through some serious trauma and I think it‚Äôs extra important to have one you can really talk to about what you‚Äôre going through.

Now he‚Äôs 20 and hasn‚Äôt done anything like that in years but he said he still worries something is wrong with him. I know he would never do anything to hurt anyone else and he has a lot of really bad mental health issues like OCD, depression, and Asperger‚Äôs.

It sounds like you've been through a lot, and I can understand why you're questioning things so deeply. Let's tackle your concerns step by step.

Firstly, about the idea of an all-loving and all-knowing God: many people struggle with the concept of suffering and why it exists if there's a divine being who is supposed to be loving and omniscient. It's a profound and valid question. The reality is, there's no easy answer that can take away the pain or the challenges you've faced due to autism or your experiences in the hospital.

Regarding your autism, it's important to recognize that conditions like autism are complex and not fully understood. It's not about punishment or imperfection; rather, it's a part of the diversity of human experiences. People with autism often have unique strengths and perspectives that contribute positively to the world, even though the challenges can be significant.

You also raised an interesting point about being made in God's image. Many interpret this as reflecting qualities like creativity, intelligence, and the capacity for relationships rather than a literal physical or mental likeness. So, it doesn't necessarily imply that God has human-like traits such as being autistic or not.

Your experience in the behavioral hospital sounds incredibly difficult and painful. It's completely understandable to question why such suffering happens, especially at a young age when you were vulnerable and needed protection. Many people wrestle with similar questions about why God, if real and all-knowing, allows suffering and injustice.

As for the idea of a bigger plan or God always being there, it's often a matter of faith and interpretation. Some believe that even in the midst of suffering, there might be lessons, growth, or eventual understanding that can come over time. Others find solace in the support of communities, loved ones, or professional help when grappling with these deep questions.

Ultimately, there's no definitive answer that can erase the pain you've endured. It's okay to feel angry, hurt, or confused about these profound questions. Many people find different ways of coping and finding meaning despite the uncertainties. If talking about it helps, I'm here to listen.

326,1degvgz,Anyone that feels the same in early 20s?,"Hi guys, I'd like to share some insights, and hopefully start a positive discussion with anyone that might feel the same, just so we may know that we are not alone in this.

So, I'm in my early 20s and lately I've really been hit by some bitter emotions regarding my life experience and where I'm currently at. Actually I would be classified as an ""on time"" or ""regular"" young adult. Right about to finish my uni studies, learned to live on my own and stuff like that. 
Still, I feel like I missed on many things both in my teenage years and in my early adulthood. When I was younger it was due to the fact that I was lacking mental care and I couldn't do many things. Now that I'm almost fully recovered thanks to a few years with professional help, I find myself in a healthier mental state, and I truly know how to face situations with a balanced attitude. But the thing is, I feel like healing took a big part of my life away, and now I'm not where I would have thought my promising life would have been. 

I started to obsess over the fact that I'm average on many things, while I'm surrounded by some cases who are making exceptional things. I never made a penny while others are having great ideas on business and succeeding in that (recently started to learn some business related skills with 0 results, and I am very discouraged. Without any money I feel like I cannot do many experiences), never gained a circle of friends (During these years I was very focused on my studies and goals, while others seemed to be on a party-mode all the time, so either was difficult to relate or it was difficult for me to find people that were lovely and interesting to be with on a deeper level. Loneliness is another big feeling rn), and overall I experienced a constant sense of trying not to stay behind other folks (and that sucked all my energy) rather than feeling like having a good starting point to learn, grow, and discover things and relationships that will make me happy and richer inside. 

I don't know how to overcome this sense of feeling lost and not having done anything special with my life. To me regular stuff is like an usual procedure that needs to be done.

Hopefully I explained myself, since this is not my mother tongue. Willing to listen from your perspective!

I wanna respond to this as I‚Äôve been through all this before.. keeping this comment here to respond to later!! (score: 1) | So here's my story, As a kid I was awful. My parents till this day tell me that nothing was hard for them except for raising me... And I see why. I was lost, had no friends, awful at education, hated social interaction, felt anxiety from interaction, no sense of direction, no energy and overall was toxic.

I met friends online due to my anxiety or meeting people in person. i used to push them away and lie and do all sorts to get my own way. I was literally toxic.

I treated my parents awfully. Like I shouted and hit them. Treated by brothers like crap. Made them do things to get paid like eating a bug and stuff like that. Like i said, i was awful. genuinely a nightmare child.

I FAILED all my educations, literally all. School, college and university. All gone. After I worked on my anxiety with a therapist and many other things like religion etc. I was still a prick and pushed all my friends away.

Now im in a much better place. I understood contentness which is something that not everyone has. Being okay with who we are. That helps when we are sad or super happy as we have a foundation to fall on.

Contentness can come from many things, finding a purpose, religion which is what helped me and sports and all sorts.

Take things slow and experiment.

Focus on making friends, going to the gym and reading. Get into hobbies.

You can find friends on reddit to meet in person near you and on discord. [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com) is good too. Churches or mosques. whichever. From there you meet one person and they introduce you to another person and so on and so on.

Anxiety is essentially chronically fear of ourselves and/or something in our environment.

All of that makes it a lot less fun to be alive and to be you. But I swear to you, when you heal the trauma and reconnect with your body/feelings/life/self, everything is so much more fun and interesting.

332,1defvso,How to deal with a manipulative selfish mother who puts on an image of a nice caring mom,"
Hello, i am trying to explain a complex situation in as less words as possible. Please deal with me. 

Long story short, i was brought up in an arab muslim family but my mom is a foreigner and became muslim when she was very young. Her childhood was filled with trauma which i believe is what led her to making that decision and run away from the toxicity. 

I love my family (me and 5 more siblings in total) and value them and my parents very much. They are dear and close to my heart, but I can‚Äôt deny that we were raised in a toxic way, where not much freedom of expression was allowed without being met with grimaces and long lectures, we were antisocial and nothing was done to address that (quiet antisocial kids is not what i would call healthy). 

Although that‚Äôs all past and i dont live in my old country anymore, the problems are haunting me because my siblings still are, two of them are still in high school. My dad died few years ago and within a year and a half, mom married another man. At first i was hesitant, but she assured us she will never leave her family and she will spend equal time with them as with her husband. This was far from the truth. 

She changed 180. She completely changed her values and opinions and became ok with things that were not accepted in our childhood, she really confused all of us and mentally added a element confusion to the loss we were already experiencing. I think my youngest siblings would not be able to comprehend that change at their age. 

She now spends around 1 or 2 days a week with them, sometimes even less. But while she found her new life, my siblings are at home, alone, antisocial as ever (because that‚Äôs the way they were brought up), and without a parent in the house. My sister is playing mom role‚Ä¶ because she has no other choice, she is first year in uni!

My mom‚Äôs irresponsible behavior and her new ‚Äúchapter‚Äù are deeply hurtful and bother me a lot. I am afraid my siblings will develop abandonment and mental issues (talking especially about the ones in high school) and i just dont know how to deal with it from afar. Talking is out of the question, i tried and she had so many counter arguments and excuses, I‚Äôm not actually sure if she‚Äôs aware how toxic or manipulative she is. 

Tldr: mom puts an image in our heads that shes a loving caring parent, but her actions say the opposite.

So now, after I wanted to change my course of study and therefore had to look for a new university, it got worse and worse. I‚Äòm living alone and I have some friends I barely meet, because they are very busy just like me before. I really want to finally step into the career I always wanted, but something holds me back. I see some good opportunities, but I‚Äòm too insecure to apply. It sounds ridiculous even for me. But it‚Äòs not everything. For example, I see people going out talking to strangers and that leads to cool experiences. Whenever I try that I have the will, but something is holding me back. I don‚Äòt even overthink possible and exaggerated outcomes, even when I think positive, it‚Äòs like a force in my chest saying ‚Äùmaybe not today‚Äú. I hate it. I‚Äòm fully aware, that this is just trauma response for keeping me safe, but being aware doesn‚Äòt help at all. Yes, I‚Äòm already seeking out for professional help. That leads to three problems: 1. In my environment, there are hardly any therapists I can effort. Also most waiting times for them are like two years or more. 2. Why do you have to call to request an appointment because of your anxiety? Whenever I talk to someone on the phone, embarrassing moments happen to me. 3. I had a bad experience with a therapist once. I was new and he didn't even looked at me the whole conversation and asked why I was there. How can you simply answer that? I had an anxiety attack which leads to him asking me out of practice. It signaled to me that me and my problems are not wanted. 
I'm sick. I just want this ‚Äùholding back force‚Äú to finally disappear. I don‚Äòt expect help from people in my environment, the topic about mental illnesses are hushed up. Stepping out of my comfort zone hardly helps me personally. I noticed that during presentations at school. It never got better, not until the end. Journaling, meditation and all that stuff doesn't do much for me either. So I‚Äòm literally asking looking at my circumstances, what advices do you have? ",5,1,new,"You wouldn't take advice from a 14 year old i'm afraid.. i feel the same man, my anxiety makes me want to kill myself, i get home and think somebody sits next to me telling my i shouldn't kill myself.. that thing is a better friend then EVERYBODY I KNOW...

338,1deez9e,Do You Ever Feel Like Nobody Else Is Real?,"I feel like I‚Äôm living in a simulation.
It feels like nobody else actually exists, like I have created the universe and my entire life is a product of my imagination.

341,1de7u9q,Obsessions and scary thoughts,"Hello.  I am worried and SCARED of myself, I might say.  I have a bizarre behavior.  I also went to the school psychologist, but it didn't help.  I've always been told that I'm weird, that I'm cringe, or that I'm childish or girly.  I always get criticized, but I don't know if what I said before is relevant. Sometimes I feel used and betrayed.  What SCARED me is that I'm daydreaming, so to speak.  I was OBSESSED with one song for 3 years.  I listened to it day and night, every day, I listened to it slowed down, I listened to it at high speed, covers, etc., I became obsessed with that song.  Since I was a child, I used to imagine if I was in the place of other cartoon characters and I would make scenarios in my head what I would do if.  And in the evening, I think from the age of 8-9-10, even before I went to bed, I imagined something to fall asleep.  Now, going back to the song, I always had scenarios if it was me singing it, if it was me in the video, if I was famous.  I kind of like being the center of attention, or that's what I'd like, although I can't stand talking to the world, because I find it boring and I don't understand their gestures.  The phase is that I found something on the net about maladaptivebdrreaming or dat dreaming and I found myself, but I don't understand why I obsess.  I, for example, in grades 5-8, had an obsession with the color gray and all my clothes were gray.  I obsess over different people, objects, things, drawings, etc.  I make scenarios, when I was little, I would lay in bed, look at the ceiling and imagine and even wave my hands.  I've noticed that I've developed an obsession with psychological anime and I admire psychopathic characters.  Please, I don't know if it falls into this category.  I feel like something is wrong with me and I can't even explain it, I can't make myself understood.  I call for help and no one hears me.  I am AWARE that something is wrong with me and I continue to live.  Sometimes I make scenarios if I kill myself, I even thought about killing myself until a child died on the street and I saw how much pain it caused the family and how the village started talking.  I need help but no one is here for me.  I found so many things on the net about being a psychopath, sociopath, ADHD, OCD, personality disorders, anxiety, etc.  But I can't make a diagnosis myself, although I have moments when I check 4-5 times in a row if I closed the door, put my glasses in the case or to check if someone is home, if I'm really alone.  I don't think I managed to cover everything I want to say and what is pressing me.  I can't say what thoughts I had cuz this post will be long , frankly, scary.  I fear.  I hope you can help me in one way or another ü•π I wanna be listened. ",1,0,new,,

344,1deaqvi,How can I (forgive/redeem my sense of confidence in) myself after a mental breakdown?,"So today, I woke up dead tired, and I was dreading the hw questions that I knew I could do pretty swimmingly, because there is also a paper to write. It was one of those days where I was going to need physical support to sit in class, so I brought my instrument case with me to hold my head up. My Dad, minding his own business, gets excited it, and I freak out internally, as if I'd been seen naked.

In the garage, I have to literally trudge through a trail of garbage to get to my car and drive to class. My laptop doesn't work without a mouse so I have this string to attach it to my bag. I am severely autistic, so this is necessary, as I literally get overwhelmed having to carry both of these items separately in my hands. 

The car is also full of junk because I share it. As I put my bag in the passenger seat, the battery cover pops off and falls somewhere I don't see. Mom sticks her head in, and after having to work really hard to make her leave, I go bloody ballistic. I am flopping around the car, getting my limbs caught from a combination of adrenaline and fatigue, and I repeatedly call for siri because I misplaced my phone and I can't get there without google maps. 

Accepting that I am going to be late, no big deal, I am heaving as I throw stuff out onto the floor and into the trunk. I find myself shrieking and sobbing out loud as I drive (100% safely, mind you) to the campus. 

Another time this has happened was when I was trying to watch youtube while walking on a treadmill. Usually I had very good motor skills, I played piano at one point, and both multitasking and cardio were big hobbies of mine. But that day, I tried to prop the thing up and jt fell, and (nobody was there) that was the first time I screamed out loud. As people perceive me, I worry that although I feel squashed into bottling it up, it has always made me weaker whenever let it out.

I really desperately need some form of practice or progressable advice, because I will just randomly have very vulnerably low mental stamina. You can think of it as a crippled ability to get comfortable. My family can and has eaten away at crucial battles in my time management and self worth. On a bad day, my brain just won't work if I don't lay down or prop myself up in some way.

345,1debjg2,"Just venting, never did this before, you can ignore this","Hi, as the title says, Im just writing this message to vent, I just don't know what to do so Im doing this, I don't even care if anyone replies, I'm probably just writing this for myself. 

My mental health has been declining the past month rapidly. My mental pain is becoming physical. I'm starting to be depressed, I've never felt so lonely in my life, and I've felt lonely my entire life a lot, this is different. My mother is a narcissist who treats me so bad and she knows she is doing something wrong but she just doesn't wanna accept it and always makes excuses. It hurts so bad, I don't think I even love her. 

My girlfriend left me almost a month ago, she was the best person I've ever met, we (she) ended it on good terms. She said she thinks we aren't compatible and she's looking for someone else and we just don't understand each other, she felt like my mental health was too much of a burden because I had noone except her. It feels like it's all my fault even tho I know it isn't. She says that she saw how much I tried and that's why she was so sad about it. But she doesn't even understand how much I love her, she has no clue. Gosh Im embarrassed cuz I think I love her more than my own mother, maybe even my father, they have never been there for me like she has, and it's not even about what she gave, it's about her as such an innocent good person. She has such a kind soul and angelic eyes, I can't even think about her, how did this happen, why did this happen.

 I'm trying to racionalize it so much, I want to go into the past and repair everything even tho I've always been so kind to her and understanding, I poured so much of the energy into the relationship, I workout, I do thai box, I try to progres mentally and yet she doesn't want me, why doesn't she want me, I'm literally told my whole by women that I'm beautiful, I've always been understanding and good to her, I've cooked for her, I wanted to help her with everything, I cared about her more than I cared about myself (which is probably a part of the problem).

 One moment I had everything I ever had in the palm of my hand, and in a second it slipped and shattered and broke me like nothing could. The pain is almost unbearable, everytime I close my eyes I see my little angel. I'm starting to have suicidal thoughts, i don't know how much I can take, they are not a stranger to me, but they are not nice. Even tho I'm not gonna do it, they are coming back. I go to a therapist and even tho he's the best therapist ever, it's still so hard. I know noone is coming to save me, It has to be me, sometimes I feel like I don't even wanna save myself. She was my whole purpose to live, I feel like I don't even wanna live for myself sometimes, sometimes I do. I don't even know what to say anymore...

My psychologist straight up told me if I moved I needed to keep seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist since I don't have a support system (+ I'm bipolar so no choice)? Was saying the same thing when telling me to go stay at a mental hospital inpatient.

I know they aren't that caring i have first hand experience, my psychiatrist is just a person that gives me a paper to refill my medication... I know they don't really care but no one does so someone that just worries about physical symptoms, of depression or mania, can feel like care by proxy in a sense? damn that makes me sound even more pathetic (score: 2) | One way I've heard this expressed by therapists is that they are not \*paid\* to care, that is something they choose to do. They \*do\* care because it provides a better service in most cases. In some instances, when their emotional boundaries are stepped on by a client which lacks empathy, they may care less about the client. They can still offer services but not care about how a client feels (like in the case of treating a difficult personality disorder client, eg NPD or ASPD). I think as a client, it's better to assume that your therapist does care. But if you feel like they don't, trust your gut; it may be better to switch to a more empathetic therapist. (score: 3) | mm yeah maybe that is true, the bar is pretty low for what I expect though, I'm just glad my therapist makes an effort to really try to understand me? that's encouraging in itself :) (score: 4) | I don‚Äôt see it that way. Would you say that about a diabetic needing care from the healthcare system? (score: 2) | I mean I don't think it's an example that would really apply there. It might be similar to lonely elderly people professional caretakers if they have no family or people close. They are just part of the healthcare system but if they're the only person their patient see, you could see it that way? (score: 2) | I have seen others make this comment. While I don‚Äôt have that experience I can see why people might. It could be a symptom of distrust. Perhaps some adult or caretaker abused your trust in the past and now it‚Äôs hard to trust anyone. Maybe you‚Äôve been left to deal with your own problems so often that you are convinced that no one can help you, but you. 

It‚Äôs worth bringing to up to your therapist. They may be able to help you work through it and understand why you are skeptical of a transactional relationship. (score: 2) | ah yeah i did get diagnosed with cptsd with regards to that, the mistrust is a core of who i am now i still struggle to see how i could really get better (score: 2) | at the same time I know that they actually don't care and I'm just a patient yk? but my life is so cold anything close to care is kinda nice?

I would kill to be able to afford either one much less both. I have never had any support of any type. (score: 2) | I'm really sorry you're not able to access any medical support :/ I'm def thankful for free healthcare. 
Also with therapists it can be possible to ask for reduced rates depending on the person and if you explain your situation. The price was what stopped me for many years to get any kind of help since I really didn't have money to spare, but I found a really understanding psychologist that lowered their rate! (score: 1) | That's super cool! I just got an email from HR this morning telling me that I qualify for insurance. I will be insured and seeking help as of July 1st!! (score: 2) | That's great I'm super happy for you!!

349,1dectb3,I want to be hurt.,"Just general TW overall I think?

I (16) want to be hurt/ill. I think about it constantly, I've dreamt about certain scenarios, I make up scenarios in my head all the time.

I am fully aware that this isn't healthy, but I so desperately want it that I can't stop thinking about it. Though I don't think I'd ever act on any thoughts to deliberately put myself in serious harms way.

From what I can remember, I've always been this way, as a child I drew scenes in hospitals (though I'd never been in one. I've never been seriously ill or even broken a bone or sprained anything.). For most of my childhood whenever I'd go to sleep I'd lay and think about and make up scenarios about me breaking bones, and as I've grown up this had continued into serious injuries and illnesses. Though I've never told anyone about this, but the recent year or so the thoughts have gotten worse,  and to say the least I have planned ways to break my own limbs just incase.

Currently, I use Character AI to role play scenarios where I get hurt/ill, and have been using since the beginning of this year, before and still I look at pictures of ill and hurt people (possibly a bit disrespectful ik) and imagine myself there. It's everything from something like Anemia (which I hope to get somewhat, I know it sounds bad), to brain injuries, stroke, breaking bones, amputation, paraplegic, quadriplegic, being inconticent, even stuff that I can't get because you have to be born with it, etc.

 Though I must note I mostly only do roleplay the real serious stuff in the moment just to imagine being there, not fully wanting it. I don't want to die. I don't want to lose maybe my sight or hearing or speech. I don't exactly want to have a stroke, you get it. I just want to be hurt.. it's hard to explain. 

I have this weird feeling, whenever I do roleplays with amputation/breaking bones/paraplegic. It's a feeling in my legs really, like something is wrong. Also I almost always think about being wheelchair bound, just paraplegic... I feel like my legs aren't supposed to be healthy and something needs to be wrong. It's such a desperate thought the wheelchair thing, I don't know why I want to be wheelchair bound but I do. And the thoughts of it are constant and intense.

I know this sounds bad. And hell I can barley even imagine having to deal with some issues and/or being in pain constantly, but I enjoy pretending. Recently I've been thinking a lot about anemia, and reading a lot about it, as to how people get it and how you treat it. 

I know this isn't normal, I am very much aware. If anyone has any tips please leave any. I don't know if I should search help (I'd have to tell my parents and I don't want that).

351,1ded9g7,my SO mental health is starting to affect me and I‚Äôm not sure how to handle it,"I (30M) have been with my partner (29F) for over a year now. We live together and generally everything is great, even talk about marriage and future on and off and are well aligned in terms of both what we want and the lifestyle we would like to live.

We both deeply love each other and do our best to support each other. My partner had a pretty traumatic and abusive relationship in her early 20s that she still struggles with to an extent today (ptsd nightmares, fear of abandonment, among other things) and while i do my best to support her and help her get through the hard times it is becoming increasingly difficult. It severely affects her mood to the point of ruining her day or making her depressed for hours on end and i feel as though it is starting to affect me.

I am a very caring individual and i deeply love her and wish she didn‚Äôt struggle with these things, but at the same time it feels like I cannot talk about us and more serious topics, or even vent about my own issues and concerns in life. I am trying to help her with coping mechanisms that have helped me in the past with some of my issues but it seems like she would rather just push her problems to the side/bottle them up instead of trying to work through them. I am not a therapist/counselor and she really needs one.

I want us to be able to build the life together we want but it‚Äôs starting to feel as though that may not be the case and my fear is in the future when/if we have kids how much of it will spill out onto them.

Does anyone have any advice as to what I can do?

352,1dedhyy,"How to free yourself from loneliness, low self esteem, and build a community","I‚Äôm a 27M who still lives with their parents in Maryland. For about the time I was in mid high school to now I‚Äôve felt incredibly lonely. Over the years I‚Äôve gone from friend group to friend group attempting to find tribe I can call my own. I‚Äôve got a handful of really good friends who are about 3 years younger than me. I have good 9-5 with good benefits that is in my line of study. Good family,  parents, sister. On paper everything seems fine. But I‚Äôm not happy. 

All my life I‚Äôve struggled with self esteem and confidence, but I never let it get to me until I was around 15-16. I isolated myself from the world in order to protect myself from all the negativity of shallow classmates and bad academic performance. In doing so I may have stunted my social and mental growth. I developed a stutter and even lower self confidence.

I found a church home recently and I like it and the people there, but I still have trouble connecting and truly bonding with folks there. To be honest I have trouble connecting to almost everyone I meet. It‚Äôs a wonder how I have the friend I have now.

I don‚Äôt really talk to anyone from high school or college anymore. I was sort of that weird socially awkward quiet kid in the back of the class. I wish I want though. I wish I was different. If I could go back in time I would change everything.

I used to be funny. I would make witty sarcastic remarks that people enjoyed hearing. Now I can barely muster up a sentence with stuttering. I want my confidence back. I want to be a person again. Someone people can look up to and respect. Someone who doesn‚Äôt get so sensitive at every negative remark thrown his way.

I take vitamin D and C (more for immunity) and used to take omega 3,6,9 and magnesium for like 6 months cause i found it helps for concentration but haven't noticed a change so i stopped.

I always take care of those close to me. It's something i like to do... unless it becomes my responsibility, then it becomes too much. Like, i live with my bf and his family and he gets depressive episodes that are pretty bad sometimes. So i make sure to bring him food and get him to come out on a walk around the block with me (or longer if he can manage). I've been getting close with his brother and I've started doing a very watered down version of taking care of him as well. (Their mom even called me the new mom of the family (she doesnt live with them))

Last year I was doing thar but also studying in uni and working and working out... didnt workout lol

I get tired after I've done ""too much"". I'm saying that in quotation marks cause that's usually if I've gone out for more than an hour.

356,1decoxe,What is it and is it serious?,"Recentely some of my weird behaviours and thoughts have been getting worse and I don't know if they are normal thus I'm overreacting or there is smt wrong with me and I should seek help.

1)When someone asks me to borrow something, especially my sister. Usually I either don't want to give away this thing bc ""it's mine"" or ""it belongs there and if you take it I'll have to worry all day about putting it back"", and if they don't give the thing back once they are done I get REALLY mad and sometimes even cry

2)I don't like unpacking my stuff from my suitcase bc then I will have to put it back on at the end of summer and if I leave there it's already ready and I don't have to fear I might lose something

3)Caring about how my things are positioned in my room and I HATE when somebody touches smt and I have to put it back in its place, mainly bc it has to be how I like it in my order and bc I'm scared I'll lose these things and maybe somebody (my sister) might take them and I won't realize.

4)When somebody wants to borrow something I might just gift it to them. Once my sister asked me if she could try my swimsuit on, and she ended up liking it so much she asked if she could borrow it and I just said she could have it. Then I went to the bathroom and cried for like a whole 20 mins and even started to cut through my skin with my nails almost to the point it bled. the only reasons I could find are that ""she deserves it more than me"", ""I wouldn't wear it either way bc it's too pretty for me and she's gorgeous so she'll definitely use it more"" and also that ""if I share it then at this point why have it"", I bought for me cause I never dress nicely bc I feel like who I am is just someone who doesn't care and maybe by buying and wearing this swimsuit I could escape this ""false/forced"" image I created and be free.

For the same reason I'm scared of dressing better: I literally wore the same 2 hoodies for the whole school year bc I had no courage to wear anything else and hear people comment (even if in a positive way).

5)Taking things as a form of self punishment and bc I don't deserve things. When I go out with my friends I don't buy anything or try to spend less as I can bc I feel too guilty spending my parent's money, also bc my sister spends a lot of it when she goes out and I fear my parents may not be able to afford another child who does this. Additionally when we're on a trip I always compare what my sister buys in total to what I bought and always hope I spent less money mainly bc if I spend less I know she can get what she wants bc after all ""she wants it"" and I should sacrifice some of my joy for hers. Like when we went to Malta once and my father took us to starbucks bc he knows I wanted to get smt there, however my sister also came and ordered something and I felt too guilty to take anything so I just said I wanted nothing.",2,1,new,"Now is the best time to practice setting boundaries.

Even if there were no mistakes, nothing was smudged or crossed out, I would still find a reason why they weren't neat enough and why I had to re-write them over and over even if I was already behind on schoolwork and REALLY didn't want to write them again. If I didn't, it would bother me for the rest of the day until I did.

I thought I'd get over it after I graduate from high school, but nope! The same thing is happening with little sticky notes I put around the house with reminders of things my husband and I need to do (file taxes, go to the grocery store for something, etc.) It's something that should only take 30 seconds or less, but I can't put them up if they are crooked, written unevenly, or whatever else the case may be.

Retroactive jealousy like REAL Retroactive jealousy is a huge red flag for mental health issues or disorders. I have BPD. If I'd have to take a stab in the dark you're in the devalue part of the cycle of an NPD.

You should break up with your girlfriend and get yourself into therapy. You are never going to see her the same way, because she's no longer ""perfect"" in your mind anymore.

The way youre obsessing over this and posting everywhere and its all you can think about...And all she did was kiss, and you took her virginity? Yeah go to therapy. 

I've seen this movie play out, lived it, my husband has NPD and I have BPD, that's 2xs the amount of  toxic/ disordered in a relationship than yours.

As in these thoughts seem to more accurately describe how I feel yet I don't fully understand them.

367,1de7otd,I have no idea what to address first with my psychiatry assessment next month. Depression/intrusive thoughts/substance abuse/A(u)DHD,"(using my throwaway account here for anonymity)

Hi there, 

I'm m/26 and I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for at least 14 years and living in Germany. 

I've been thrice to psychologists and psychiatrists (2019, 2022 and 2024) but most of them didn't seem to be of huge help. The only thing I've actually got from all those visits is that I was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago, which is so far unmedicated. Also low-support need autism is running in our family's genes and I show tons of traits, but I don't want a diagnosis for this. 

The next assessment with a new psychiatrist is set in early July, but I hope to move it into June, because I'm really falling apart currently. In the beginning I had only set the appointment to medicate my ADHD, but as you'll read further there's a couple of more issues that really need to be addressed.

After a breakup from a three year relationship in February I fell into a deep hole again with returning suicidal thoughts, abuse of alcohol, reckless driving and intrusive thoughts (offending and sexually abusing others, self harm, suicide). Especially the mentioned intrusive thoughts are eating me up and I'm utterly disgusted by them, because I know that they are bullshit and would only harm other people. 

After nearly half a year I can say that I got mostly over the heartbreak, but the depression, the unmedicated ADHD and those nasty intrusive thoughts are eating me up.

I'm at a point where I can still handle everything, like I'll only drink too much if I have the next day off and also I wouldn't get in my car after drinking, but I have no idea for how long I can handle this. 

To my further situation, I've got a stable job in our public healthcare system, I'm living on my own with my cat and I've got a couple of friends I can call and visit on regular basis, but I avoid to do so because I don't really want to be burden to them or my mother. 
Also I'd consider myself compliant and self-aware enough to be left unsupervised without harming myself or others, so I'd actually prefer to do a therapy in our day clinic nearby. 

What should I address first? Even as a medical professional I couldn't tell for myself which problem has to be fixed first.

Thank you!

368,1debctg,Obsessed with my mother.,"Hey everybody. I‚Äôve been struggling a lot lately. My mental health has gone for a toss. My whole lifestyle is about eating and sleeping and lying on bed scrolling my phone all day. My thoughts are so miserable that I can‚Äôt act on anything. I don‚Äôt feel like life is worth living and I feel all I am waiting for now is death. I am literally depressed.

 I‚Äôm turning 20 soon, I‚Äôm in college. I have no friends. I only interact with my few ‚Äúfriends‚Äù when I am in college. I have no individual identity of my own. 

Whatever I do I only do with my mom. It‚Äôs been this way ever since I was a child obviously. I love her insanely and she is equally obsessed and insane about me. I feel as a daughter, I should be there for her. She has lived a miserable life which has been full of struggles and she continues to live that. She has a certain amount of health issues as well. She is in an unhappy marriage ever since she was 16, my brother too has turned out to be a douche. All she has is me.

I can never have somebody better than her even as a friend, nobody compares to her. I can share anything and everything with her that one might share with their friends. From talking about boys, spirituality, deepest of conversations and deepest of secrets; we do it all. I have no filter with her, it‚Äôs as if she and I are just one person and not two different people. She is so wonderful and I am so in love with her that I am deeply attached. I am obsessed with her to a point that all I ever think of what will I do if she‚Äôs gone? I have recurring thoughts of her leaving me. I can‚Äôt function without her. The thought of her not being with me throughout my life horrifies me so much that I am literally depressed. She is not the problem my attachment and our wonderful irreplaceable  bond is.

She is not happy with her life and I am her only source of happiness. i am soooooo scared and am unable to perform proper functions in life. Even if she goes out for a minute, I‚Äôll think of the worst case scenarios and doubt her safety and it will be all that I think about no matter where I am. We are not doing that great financially which is an added stress to her life and mine too. I don‚Äôt see a way out of this and I am too hopeless. Please help me I don‚Äôt know how to go about it in life. I feel so helpless . How do I help her and myself??? ",2,1,new,"One thing you need to understand is that you and your mom share a strong bond, likely influenced by the way you were raised. Your mom needs to recognize this and encourage you to go out and try new things. Since you mentioned financial stress, why not start by getting a job?

This situation isn't healthy for either of you in the long run, and it's important that both you and your mom understand this.

Moreover, consider seeing a therapist or counselor together. Both you and your mom should prioritize self-care. This includes regular exercise, hobbies, and relaxation like meditation or yoga (score: 1)",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1debctg/obsessed_with_my_mother/

I've struggled to some extent my whole life with these things but l used to at least be able to get some things done (even some really big things/a lot of things at certain points in my life), but the last year or so I have been completely worthless.

It literally takes everything I have mentally and physically to pull myself out of bed and usually late in the morning/early afternoon. I have so many things I want to do mentally and have several journals filled to the brim with to do lists and ideas and things to remember. But I never do or remember any of them.

It's become genuinely crippling at this point. My house looks like an episode or hoarders and I've lost all will to live. I can't work. I can't accomplish tasks around the house. My family and everyone around me is so fer and annoyed and beginning to hate me. And I feel awful.

I want to do all these thinas so badly. I get frustrated and just cry and cry all the time because I feel like such a lazy loser and a failure. But I can not remember/focus on ANYTHING.


I'm just at a loss here. I don't know what is wrong or how to fix it. I have no quality of life at this point and am worthless to the world and those around me. I've tried everything I can think of and all the ""adhd focusing"" tips I've seen online. I've tried breaking things down into smaller tasks. Making to do lists with one task at a time.
Attempting to fix my sleep schedule. I've asked those around me to help keep me on track but they all have their own lives and jobs and don't have time to babysit me all day. My psych didn't listen to me at all. I'm ready to give up.

Please help and please be nice. Thanks.

Even if I strained my brain as hard as possible, it's like l've never even seen/heard the thing before.

I want to do all these things so badly. I have so many plans and ideas and goals and dreams. But I quite literally can not do anything. I struggle to remember everything. I will think of something and by the tim grabbed a journal and a pen its completely gone ou my brain and never coming back (and given that I have about 15 journals at least one in every room and my car etc. thats not very long). I get frustrated and just cry and cry all the time because I feel like such a lazy loser and a failure. But I can not remember/focus on ANYTHING.

I don't know what is wrong with me but I'm at my breaking point mentally. I am so depressed and insecure and filled with shame and self hatred at this point and no one understands. Everyone thinks l'm just lazy, but I have never been a lazy person. 
I've always had multiple jobs and hobbies and been the type of person that can't just sit still and always gets things done.

I have no idea what has happened to me but I don't even recognize myself anymore. My partner says l'm a completely different person. I'm just like a frazzled chicken with its head cut off always running around trying to do a million things and never actually doing any of them and l'm always late. Like hours late.
And I don't understand how. I genuinely have lost all concept of time. I will honestly feel/believe that only a few minutes has past and really it's been an hour. This I think upsets me most of all. I'm honestly scared that I have an alternate personality coming out and doing things that I don't remember or something because can not for the life of me figure out where all my tir going. Like I have no idea what I have done that has taken so long. I feel like l've been standing there doing my makeup for 5 minutes and I do nothing else, don't leave that spot, don't pick up my phone, don't get distracted and it's simple quick makeup just lashes and some blush and lipgloss. 
I look down and 45 minutes has passed and I do not understand how.

I'm becoming so stressed out and miserable from this and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I explained this to my new psych as l've recently moved out of state, and she just put me back on Prozac which has helped my mood a little bit in the general sense but that's it. It hasn't helped any of the problems I just explained. 

I'm also becoming very prone to panic attacks and breakdowns. I've struggled with panic attacks since I was about 6 yo and they were severe during my teenage years/early adulthood but kind of lightened up as I got farther into my 20s. I'm now having at least one full blown anxiety attack (panic attack? I'm not sure what/if any the difference is) a day, if not more.
And I have moments where even the smallest thing sends me over the edge and I meltdown like a toddler that needs a nap. I clench my fists and just tense up and shake and begin to cry and sometimes almost growl/clench my teeth kind of thing and I feel like I'm literally going to explode. Which given the fact that I am an adult woman, is very embarrassing, but I can't help it. I have to walk around telling myself out loud ""calm down. Don't freak out. Don't freak out. Relax.

But after some time I noticed some changes , he started to get a little clingy and playful with her . I didn't really thought much about it as it was something he normally does around girls and it wasn't much at the time. But eventually These things just increased and her behaviour changed , when he was around compared to when I was. They were in their own world and i was just there present invisible between the laughters . If someone saw them it would seems like they're dating even though they're not . I was so confused and still am . My feelings didn't matter a single bit. Anything I did was not enough. Any care given by me was not enough cuz he'll arrive and save the day for her. I did try to express my feelings several times but every time it was either taken as a joke or me trying to pull her leg. I did do it properly one time but she just didn't answer properly. I even told him to stay away from her and respect my boundaries but he didn't even though he constantly bragged about it. He tried to hide it thinking I wouldn't notice but I did.

hallucinations refer to the brain picking up sensory information that isn‚Äôt there, so smelling, tasting, seeing, hearing, or feeling something that isn‚Äôt real. the most common hallucinations are visual

delusions are beliefs that are extremely removed from reality, there are a lot of different kinds, these include persecutory, feeling like someone or a group of people are ‚Äúafter you,‚Äù persecutory is the most common delusion, referential, when you believe that normal events mean something special, like seeing codes that you believe are specifically meant for you to find in newspaper writings, grandiose, meaning you believe that you are on top of the world, delusions of grandeur are also common in those with bipolar I when they experience a manic episode as well as those with narcissism, you may believe that you are secretly famous or have exceptional talents that you don‚Äôt actually have, erotomanic, where you believe that someone is in love with you that isn‚Äôt, often this is directed at someone famous, nihilistic, where you believe the world is ending, somatic, which many people without schizophrenia have, it‚Äôs when you‚Äôre suffering emotionally and mentally but your brain decides that it‚Äôs time to take this emotional pain and turn it into physical pain, the last delusions are classified as ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù delusions and usually have something to do with feeling like your thoughts are being controlled, either they are being removed, forcefully put there, or otherwise manipulated through non-logical means

disorganized speech/thinking is when your thoughts or speech don‚Äôt make sense, sometimes they don‚Äôt make sense to the person themselves having them but often they are unable to notice that they aren‚Äôt making sense

disorganized or unusual motor behavior refers to becoming catatonic, where you hold a position and are unable to move yourself, when in this state others can move their body and they would hold that position even when let go, it also refers to repetitive movements that don‚Äôt fall under stimming or ticcing (score: 3)",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1de9sz8/what_does_shizophrenia_mean/

She almost completely stopped cooking and left me, my 13yo sister, my 12yo sister and my 9yo brother to fend for ourselves.

It went on like that for a little while, until these last couple of years.

Now, whenever I cook and someone walks into the kitchen, I just stop what I'm doing and kinda cower down until they leave. I get super anxious when someone is close and especially embarrassed and upset when someone looks at my food. And I CANNOT eat in front of people. I just can't, no matter how much I want the food or whatever, I just can't. I also eat like 20 times a day, and I'm not talking snacks, I mean damn near full course meals! I eat even more when upset. I can eat till my stomach hurts and is about to burst, but then I'm hungry again like 20 minutes later. My stomach will feel like it did before eating and I get pekish. I Also can't stop myself when I get going. Like if I'm eating a bag of chips and I'm told to save some for another day, once I start eating them, I cannot stop and keep eating until they are gone. Doing this has actually gotten me into trouble acouple times.
I always feel bad about eating so much, but I can't help myself, it doesn't stop.

But the weirdest thing is currently happening. About five days ago, I moved in with some family. They are all super nice and constantly offer me food, but I refuse. I haven't eaten since I've got here. I'm starving and want food, but I just can't bring myself to eat here. They tell me to make myself at home and get any food I want, but I just can't. The most I get is a bottle of water from the kitchen before scurrying back to the room I'm staying in. I've never gone this long without food, and it feels so weird. My Aunt has even pointed out that I'm losing weight(I was 190 before I moved here) and have no clue how much I weigh now, but I don't see a difference. But then again, I constantly see myself different everyday and my body shape is different Everytime I look, so I don't know.

I was just curious if I could have an ED because my Cousin was talking with my Grandma about me not eating since I got here, and my Aunt chiming in that she didbthe same and it's because she had an ED. So I was just wondering if that could be the reason for all this",1,1,new,"**Hello u/!**

385,1de8tcp,I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me.,"TW: for eating disorders but i‚Äôm not so sure because I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with one but it involves an unhealthy eating pattern so ya‚Ä¶

Hi! I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me‚Ä¶ Me and my partner are going through a weird time I mean I guess she broke up with me but I still have a chance to win her back so I still have hope and I‚Äôve been trying my best. I‚Äôve never really been the anxious type and emotions are usually strong for me. I went to a psychologist one and she even said I am be sympathetic for ASPD but I didn‚Äôt go back to her so I wouldn‚Äôt have a diagnosis. When I was young, maybe around 13-14 I went to the ER and I can‚Äôt remember the reason why and the DR mentioned something about anxiety and made my dad get me pills which I didn‚Äôt take. 

Due to the events I previously mentioned‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt been able to eat. Before the ‚Äúevent‚Äù I would eat a lot and I was gaining weight which I liked because I‚Äôm skinny and I‚Äôd like to be bigger. Ever since the incident I haven‚Äôt been able to look at food or eat much because I constantly feel like vomiting my guts out. I actually did once after a phone call with her. Even without food in my stomach it feels full but it hurts cause it‚Äôs empty at the same time. Just seeing food makes me wanna throw up and I don‚Äôt know why. I can‚Äôt eat as much as I did before and now all I do is drink water to make the pain go away. I‚Äôve been crying almost everyday and I don‚Äôt know what is happening to me because I‚Äôve been through a lot of bad things in this life and yet this is the only thing that has ever managed to put me in this state. I‚Äôve never cried this much in my life and I‚Äôve never hated food so much in my life either. I‚Äôm not asking for sympathy or pity.

People in school describe me as cute, kind-hearted, and smart but I don't think so anymore.

Every school night I would study from 6 pm to 3 am to get my grades up for the expectations of my school but never made it in the list of honors. My elders would tell me to grow up and practice for the adult world but they wouldn't let me out by myself nor help me. My cousins would make fun of my attitude because I always acted childish. And seeing them all get so frustrated and disappointed in me makes me guilty and want to disappear from this world.

Just sit or lie down and close your eyes.. watch these thoughts arise in your mind. Don't fight, don't clench your jaws. Do nothing.

But trust me once you successfully avoid reacting in any way, then it's just uphill from there .

I had just cruised through life up until then fighting some major anxiety and minor depression and in my year off I decided I had to study for this national competitive exam in an effort to at least try and go somewhere prestigious for my masters. 

Except couldn't find it in me to study as much as I needed to. I only did like a month of actual prep. I managed to clear the exam, with a really bad rank (1922 out of ~14300). And it isn't good enough to get into one of the Good  Universities ‚Ñ¢ in my country (I've already got rejected from quite a few of them).

Which means there's a very high likelihood that I'll have to go back to the uni I did my bachelor's in to get an MSc. And I'm dreading it so badly because my professors there (while reasonable people) have been making snide comments about how I wasn't good enough to go anywhere else and how I should have just come back instead of wasting a year. 

My parents are disappointed in me too. I made them spend money unnecessarily. And I feel so useless because of all of this. 

I keep thinking about how I should have just gone back to the same uni in the first place. At least then in another year I'd have a job and be able to pull my weight in the house. Or if I choose to take a year off, I should've studied harder, but instead I could barely get out of bed at all. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. Why can I not stop scrolling through Instagram even though I need to. Like I'm not even enjoying the reels I'm watching, but I feel so stuck. And now it feels like any progress I made to get over how much I hate myself has completely vanished. 

I just don't know how to change. I feel stuck and in a haze all the time and I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Everybody in my circle is doing so well, and I'm sitting here crying because I can't bring myself to do anything. I am tired. Of this. I don't know what to do.

398,1de695v,Not sure if it's thr right place to ask this but ...,"First of all sorry for the quality of my english! 

I (M 25) always have been kind of a loner by choice ( I just really love to be at peace in my own world enjoying art,culture,history, science and all kind of things). I don't really have difficulty making friends or whatever (I'm someone really apreciate  in my different environment and I've no problem developing strong bond with people) but I've notice recently that as far as I can remember (except with my close friends) when I interact with people my brain feel weird.  Maybe kind of numb is not the right word but I would say saturated especially in the front part of my brain.
 Also I feel like it's draining me way more energy that it should be and it's more and more difficult to just act like it's noting. I'm not sure what I might do wrong but this is definitely something I have to ""repair "" in a way or an other!
 Any advice or someone with a similar experience?

402,1de5pqn,Any mental health conditions similar to my ME/CFS crashes?,"Please note I do not self harm or plan to. But I did mention ‚Äòsuicidal thoughts‚Äô which is why I tagged it. 

I would love to see a psychiatrist one day to explore what other conditions my ME/CFS (chronic fatigue) crashes may overlap with. I thought I might post on here and see if any non-MECFS folk have similar experiences due to other conditions.

My biggest question is around conditions that can cause a quick onslaught of extreme negative emotions and thoughts, ones that are not consistent with your mental state outside of the experience. Ones that may be associated with sensory sensitivities and loss of body movement. 

My experience during my crashes:

A crash will usually be triggered by too much noise and light stimulation, stress, or over exertion of my energy.

I can feel it coming on as I become light and noise sensitive, and I start to lose movement in my body. I‚Äôll need to lay in my bed in complete darkness with earplugs. At the same time as these sensory sensitivities I have an intense emotional reaction. My heart is racing, with crippling anxiety, but at the same time it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been injected with a depressive drug that makes the whole world in slow motion, and it brings up extreme levels of depression, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts. 

It‚Äôs strange though because I have a full mental awareness of these thoughts and feelings. I can observe them come in and out alongside the other symptoms. I know I would never act on them but they feel very real. 

The experience will last anywhere from 1-3+ hours where I just remain in the dark with no noise until I start to come out of it. I can never fall asleep due to the high levels of anxiety. Though I wish I could. 

Once I come out of the crash I can monitor that the sensory sensitivities, negative emotions and ability to talk and move all improve together.

I‚Äôm then left in a kind of hungover state for a few days where my fatigue is worse, a little sad. But nothing like in the crash. It‚Äôs a very separate experience. Almost like the fatigue shuts down an area in my brain responsible for controlling and keeping in check every fear in my psyche or something. 

Also kind of feels like a bad drug trip or something. Honestly, terrifying. ",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1de5pqn/any_mental_health_conditions_similar_to_my_mecfs/

My problem is not my interactions with him anymore because my last message to him were ""I know you gave up on us because there is another person"" and I completely blocked him everywhere and disappeared from his life, even deleted all my social media so he'll never find me again.

It's just that our response to those thoughts and memories changes.
There's a concept in Buddhism, where Buddha says pain is caused by two arrows. The first arrow is the incident that the world throws at you. Like in your case the first arrow is your break-up. And the second arrow is our response to the pain caused by the first arrow.

We can't do anything about the first arrow. It will always be there. All we can do is just accept it and don't make a universe around it. Like always crying ... Why it happened to me, why he did that and blah blah. Or doing something crazy like deleting your social media accounts. Your response should never be on the extreme side . 

Just accept it and don't react to it. No need to do anything good or bad about it. You'll be reminded of him everyday. The more you react to those memories the stronger they will be. You wake up in the morning, your mind reminds you of him, just get up and do something physical...a quick walk or jog. Slowly these memories would fade away.

412,1de13hv,I'm very lonely yet I push everyone away and don't want anyone near me,"Late 20s. Struggled with depression for at least 11 years and I'm in a dark place.

I don't have any friends (my contacts are literally my parents and my brother), never any serious relationships, no acquaintances, never worked a proper job. I used to have internet friends though they either disappeared or I pushed them away. I had friends as a child though I became depressed and then when school ended they disappeared.

I have ALWAYS wanted friends and a relationship. I yearn for people to play games with, to be in a group chat with and to hang out with, and I yearn for intimacy and cuddles.

However, as soon as any opportunity for these two things this arise, I immediately feel awful. I literally never want them to talk to me again or come near me again. Nothing bad happens, there's no 'incident' - I feel immense guilt, shame, fear, anxiety. I will literally shiver and shake. I try and do as much deep breathing as I can over and over again and continuously reassure myself with calm and positive affirmations etc. and it does literally nothing.

Even the other day I tried to find an internet friend to game with through an app. Someone messaged me and they looked like the sort of person I'm looking for, and I immediately went into meltdown and 30 minutes later deleted everything. And this was for someone on the other side of the world who only said ""hey :)""....

I don't get it. It ruins me. It's stopping me from making any connections and it scares me how extreme it feels - it's not just a bit of worry, it controls me and overwhelms me, I freeze solid.

11 years of seeing therapists and trying all sorts of medications, plus doing my own research, has yielded no answers or solutions.

This means that I've stopped trying. I don't try and seek out things, I simply try and accept it... thus I'm very lonely and if I stopped going to the gym I would be almost completely isolated.

Start by creating a calorie deficit, so (for example: aim for 1700 calories a day and try to burn off 2000 calories), that can be from lifting weights, walking, running, swimming, try just walking slow for 50yrds then walk fast for 50yrds and keep doing this, a bit of High Intensity Interval Training is good for fat burning, you don‚Äôt need to go on long runs as that builds endurance. Just make sure you enjoy the exercise that you are doing, and then every fortnight give yourself a cheat day and eat your favourite meal, and then get back on it.

Eating less and staying active is the key. But since you have mentioned you are doing these things and you already have reduced your food intake significantly (kudos üòÅ), I'd recommend measuring how much you eat.

It leads to frustration and overall bad health. 

A calorie deficit can be achieved by eating what you like in limited quantities.

Start slow by sleeping on time, drinking lots of water and be happy. You've made progress. Stay focussed.

414,1de10bw,I kinda suck,"
I dont have the right to be upset. I‚Äôm the cause of most of my problems . I don‚Äôt know how to communicate to people properly. How I am feelings is difficult for me to put into words when it‚Äôs really the most important. I don‚Äôt know how to fix myself. I am tired of messing up. I‚Äôm tired of bringing people down with me because I can‚Äôt figure myself out. I would be better off not in this world. It would‚Äôve been better if I had never existed. My chest hurts. My throat hurts too. I hate feeling like this. Little things get to me so easily. I must suck to be around. That‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt want to talk to me. I probably seem unwelcoming. I never know what to say. I always feel like people dislike me but it‚Äôs probably just in my head. Maybe I‚Äôm not pretty enough to be approached, I know outward appearance also matters. I hate seeing myself in the mirror. I‚Äôm so ugly. Without makeup or my hair done I‚Äôm hideous. Maybe that is also what makes me unappealing and unapproachable. If I wasn‚Äôt so scared of dying I would kill myself but I‚Äôm too scared to. I feel so disconnected from everyone around me. All I do is cause problems for people. I have very little to bring to society and to other people‚Äôs lives. I‚Äôm a burden. I hate that people do things for me. I wish I had a career so I could just move out. I wish I could move far away. I wish I had someone I felt truly connected to. I feel so lonely all the time. I can never do anything right. What do I live for that‚Äôs actually valuable? I am no one‚Äôs #1. But I don‚Äôt have to be. But I want to be. I want so badly to be close to people but it‚Äôs so difficult for me. I wish I could explain my feelings better to people. I wish little things didn‚Äôt bother me. I wish I wasn‚Äôt emotional. I wish I couldn‚Äôt feel things because then I wouldnt react the way I react. I‚Äôm tired of working and I‚Äôm tired of school. I‚Äôm tired of always having to rely on someone. I‚Äôm tired of acting like a child. But I have childlike emotions and actions. I wasn‚Äôt like that before. Only now that I‚Äôm an adult, I‚Äôm here feeling and acting like a child. I am turning 19 in a month. I don‚Äôt want to be an adult. I‚Äôm so scared. There is something wrong with me. I‚Äôm not normal. I don‚Äôt want to live with my mom or my dad. They are divorced. I hate my mom, but I want so badly to not hate her. I always come back to her. And always ends badly. But I love her and I want so badly to have a good relationship with her. I feel so out of places at my dads. I love my dad so much. But my mom always tell me how he never did anything for me, he never cared. I can‚Äôt do this anymore. But I don‚Äôt to live alone. I can‚Äôt live alone. So what do I do? I‚Äôd rather die. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm falling apart. Why do I do the things that I do, why do I act the way that I act. I wish I knew why I respond to things the way i respond.

415,1de4za4,My mum's mental health is destroying me,"My mum has struggled with mental health issues pretty much her entire life. Ever since she got divorced with my Dad in 2003, there was a three-year period where everything was okay. She used to clash with my sister quite a lot for over 18 years since she met her current partner and this soon stopped when she moved down south in the UK in 2021. She takes care of her mother full time and is also a full time carer. She cries pretty much every time I go and see her and won't seek any help due to family disputes and financial issues.

I almost feel like I've been around family members arguing my entire life and have never known anything different. But it's gotten to a stage now where I feel like I've had enough, I'm filled with anger all of the time and feel incapable of crying as I've trained myself so well to bottle up my emotions. It's got so bad that I feel like I can't even go out and meet a woman of my own due to how I'm feeling. I've been single for 4 years and don't know how to deal with simple things like arguments or disagreements anymore. I live by myself and suffer with immense loneliness. 

My mum only has me that lives nearby and no-one else. I've put off going to work in London due to the immense guilt that I feel on a daily basis that I'm unable to help her with her problems. She won't seek professional help, she doesn't want a partner, she won't get a new job, she won't downsize her home to save money. 

I'm happy to elaborate further if anyone has any questions but I just feel completely broken. Any advice would be appreciated.",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1de4za4/my_mums_mental_health_is_destroying_me/

419,1de4eis,I lie to myself so much I dont know what‚Äôs real anymore,"
hi reddit, I lowkey hate asking for opinions or advice, but I have no sources irl to go to about this and I just feel very lost. ever since turning 21 this past year, I have had numerous breakdowns because I feel that I dont know myself. everything I have ever known over the years whether it be my opinions, interest, feelings, etc. doesn‚Äôt feel like my OWN opinions.. like im lying to myself but say, think, and do these things for the validation for everyone else around me.
i‚Äôve been reflecting a lot on my childhood and teenage years and realized almost everything I ‚Äúloved‚Äù and worked towards was for my parents to be proud of me and for my peers to be impressed by me. I have stuck to these things for years and ‚Äúperfected‚Äù them, but I feel so bored of it all but I constantly told myself I love it. now, it feels like maybe I hate those things but I also cannot imagine myself discarding and not doing those things.. so if I dont want to let go, do I love it?

overall, I feel like the hugest liar. i wonder if im lying to everyone and if I am lying to myself. I dont know myself and dont know how to get to know myself without the lies and constant need for validation.  this constant way of thinking is driving me crazy because I cannot stand being around me or anyone anymore so I sleep all the time to avoid thinking like this and feeling like every time I open my mouth to someone, im lying to them for their approval of me and using that to validate myself. I simply dont trust myself. 
I wish to feel so sure in myself that I KNOW what I like for ME, have opinions for MYSELF, and live for myself. but I am so confused with myself I just wanna ditch me and everything. not wanting to die but.. not deal with me. idk. have any of you gone through this? or understand what I am trying to say?

I remember parents complaining about me and feeling like a complete idiot when I was trying to help do handling (like helping babies roll over) and one baby bumped his head on the floor (not like a huge whack but it made a sound).

I try my best not to over rely on my friends, but I will admit I've needed a little more support as of late because this year has been very difficult for me and I'm just so tired and uncertain about the future.

And then I see this sentiment that depressed partners in romantic relationships are a burden. Non-depressed partners going on about how they're tired of their partner's mental health problems, how they suck the life out of them.

Depression is such an isolating illness. No one can reach into your head and take the pain away from you. You have to put in the work and save yourself. People get tired of listening because they have their own problems. And to think that I have to be on high alert not to burden my partner makes me think it might be better if I remain single.

No one is perfect, everyone has baggage. Ppl in a relationship are not free from mental health problems.

Ofc, provided both parties try to improve everything and is not just a Black hole of zero effort.

OP, If ppl with depression shouldn't be in relationships, do you know how many people shouldn't be in relationships? TOOOOOOONS. Did you know ppl with adhd are more prone to depression? Like a high percentage? By your logic most ppl with adhd shouldn't be in relationships.

And it is such a wonderful thing to see each other overcoming and growing!

However I want to make it clear that this particular person didn't ""believe"" in therapy and would be offended at the mere suggestion of getting help. His idea of ""therapy"" was downloading a PDF from some website and read about how to deal with triggers/anxiety...and tbh I saw almost no difference. I let him seek his own version of help without pushing my suggestion any further (I am a huge advocate for therapy and I go consistently) but at the end of the day I saw him continually spinning his wheels and going in circles therefore, I could not hang anymore. He would justify the toxic thoughts/bad behavior by saying things like ""this is just how I am"" ""this is how I express myself"" and that was pure BS. That is how you CHOSE to handle yourself. 

  
SO at the end of the day, can someone with mental health issues have a relationship? Yes of course. HOWEVER burdening people is not ok.

I was the pleaser, emotional childhood trauma being passively unwanted, searched for unconditional love in relationships,  but of course they were dysfunctional. I was kind of co addicted, was attracted to women with needs so I didn't need to take care of myself. I had them all. Anorexia, Borderline, PTSD, histrionic, narcissistic, you name it. Multiple therapies diagnosed multiple disorder symptoms but never enough to break it down to one specifically. BC I was too intelligent and adapted everything. So it was mostly ""depression BC of too high expectations"".

The following 2 years were hard and exhausting.2020 toughest Christmas ever, first time being alone in my life. I cried a lot, emptied a bottle of wine, cried more and suddenly sth changed. I said to myself 
""You cry about being lonely and that nobody is there to hug you. So why don't you hug yourself?""
From there I started listening to myself and my needs. Practising self love. Read a lot of bs books, nothing helped. That's stuff for women, I'm practical. If I can't grab it it's useless. 

A year later it was like ""meh. 2021 Christmas? Hell yeah I'm gonna celebrate myself!"" I grew with my tasks...

Went to a lot of festivals in my life caus music is the key to my emotions and with my enthusiasm and being 100% me and authentic I catched lots of women.

 Last year I quit after 15 years as I still felt lonely surrounded by people and began to understand that the search for a relationship is useless as long as I don't fulfill the needs to have one. A healthy one. Surely I can go and find a women with needs again and take care of her, but what about myself? I'm fucking worth it. I allow myself to so the things I want to do because I'm worth it. So I started this year by focusing on what I need. Which I might not know about yet. Doing things I was always curious about. Easy things that make me happy independently from others, things I can do alone. Like playing keyboard, learning Spanish and hiking. In 2 weeks ill  start my first big cycling tour (300km) and I'm nervous AF. So to sum it up, enjoying myself and treating myself as my best friend. And when I'm confident with my fucked up life, poor as I am, then i might attract a woman that sees beyond that shit and worships me for my experience. Until then I keep enjoying the little things. 

You have to be a reliable person to yourself to be able to run a relationship on eye level and not on dependencies, that's my only advise I can give. Treat yourself like you want to be treated by others. Find sth that is only yours and makes you happy. 

You never get what you want, you only get what you are, so stop focusing on what you want but rather on what you need. Trust me, having quality time with yourself is much much more beneficial than being in a dysfunctional relationship...

And this I'm learning right now. I stopped complaining and started changing. Face your fears and watch the shadows fade. I want to be the best version of myself.

If I can give some advice...

You don't have to be single, but be open with who you are and what you can and can't do. My ex said that she thought I'd change, and...I just didn't.

Go in knowing (and letting them know) that your mental health will affect them as much as physical health would. Someone who is super active and goes rock climbing and hiking every weekend would need to consider how the physical health of someone with a serious knee injury would affect a relationship and if that's acceptable to them.

You, all of you, is worth it to someone, but just like we might have limits to what we would accept in a partner, others do too. If one person can't handle someone with depression for a relationship, that's ok. That doesn't mean no one can. Everyone comes with positives and negatives, and it's a question of compatibility, not worth. I love my cats, and I could never date someone who is allergic...and that's ok for me and people with cat allergies that we're not compatible.

I'm sure you'll find someone that will help you through those hard times and celebrate the good with you. Give you someone to lean on while helping you stand on your own.

You should look for that. You shouldn't get down on yourself when it's hard to find, when others can't be what you need, or even when you can't be what others need.

Curious to hear your very personal take on that.

Thanks!",8,28,new,"I believe your intentions are good, but I really don't think AI has any place in mental healthcare. It's not truly cognizant, it doesn't have any real understanding of human psychology, and it can not empathize with people. AI, in its current state, is merely a device that identifies patterns in data. It can determine correlations between elements in a data set, and usually, it does this very well, but the types of neural networks we have in our brains which do all of the wonderful things human brains can do, we have not yet figured out exactly how they work in nature, let alone how to reproduce those functions in artifice.

Furthermore, all this talk of AI in mental healthcare, as I see it, only offers a distraction from the real problem, which is that healthcare in general has been relegated to the private market, where profit is king. This, of course, has been a long process of legislation in the United States Congress and Supreme Court. The Office of the President has also played a role, via appointment powers, vetos, and executive orders regarding the state of the economy. What we really need is simple, and that is de-capitalize healthcare. Insurance corporations have, in their pursuit of profit, done what any rational corporate actor would do in a capitalist economy, and that is to raise the price of care to maximize revenue, which will inevitably force lower earning patients into being in debt or being uninsured and avoiding treatment at all costs. (score: 8) | I would say AI that would interact with the public isn't up to the task. AI itself could be useful as a tool now and do a lot more later, exactly because it can see data so well and potentially recognize patterns that humans wouldn't (both due to the fact it can work tirelessly and because it can take all data into account).

But the AI that would be doing this would be taking information from volunteers and interfacing with professionals for quite a long time.

I think a lot of people don't consider AI like this and think of things like Siri, ChatGPT, social media algorithms, or...google search now...ugh, sorry I had to bring up what a trash heap that has become.

There's no reason that actually solid medical AI couldn't become public facing at some point, but that doesn't help us here and now. Getting capitalism out of healthcare is what we need in the here and now.

Some AI to try to nudge you now would likely be useless, at best (and more likely actively harmful), but if someone were to invest in AI for this purpose now, it's possible that it could be a useful tool in a few decades to a century. The problem being capitalism in healthcare again, since that's far far too long to see a chance of return (and so anything AI related is more likely to be poorly made with marketing behind it, rather than actually good).

Even if i am desperate, i do not wish for the dominant class to have even more access to our mental weaknesses and illnesses.

The dominant class also benefits, worsen and cause many mental health issues. 

In a society where we were not rules by exploitative, parasitic rich people/corpos, why not? I would like to try, sometimes it can be good to vent and exchange, even if its not a real person, when you feel distressed?

Well, I‚Äôve overcome a 6-year-long depression which was triggered mainly by the death of my partner at the age of 19. I couldn‚Äôt afford therapy at first so I had to learn how to cope on my own. 

Once I saved up for a single therapy session and asked the therapist what can I do to keep myself afloat. He taught me to meditate and recommended two books by Viktor Frankl. That helped to sustain me for a while. 

Over the years, I have deepened my meditation practice and at this point I meditate 1-2 hrs a day. It's my cornerstone practice of checking in with myself and maintaining my mental health in a good shape. It works on many levels but I won't get into that since you've asked about mental health purely.

I've ended up doing therapy too, once my financial situation improved, and that, of course, was a major boost to my mental health. 

I have developed a toolset of crisis-management practices too which I use to regulate myself in times of difficult life situations when stress and anxiety can feel overwhelming. 

Most of all, the equanimity and acceptance I developed through meditation, and the ability to observe my thoughts without delving too much into them help me to bounce back much faster from major life challenges and to remain peaceful and even content (deep down) when everything around me seems to be falling apart. 

I am going through one major life remodelling now, which is very unexpected, so I speak from fresh experience.

Happy to explain more if you'd like to explore a specific aspect or have questions :) (score: 1) | I honestly don't know if it would be that effective... Every person is different, so it would take the AI quite some time to acknowledge what's happening to you compared to someone else. Why am I sleeping less - and is that a problem or a good thing? Maybe I'm not having a panic attack but my heart is racing and my breathing is quick because I'm genuinely in a dangerous situation? What if my daily routine changed because I chose to do so or because I was finally able to?


AI needs to be fed information to learn, but depending on who creates it, the information is bound to have its limits. Especially since, well, everyone is different. Maybe it's just because our school made a little project regarding it and - holy moly - it was a biased AI! Because my classmates back then were, well, biased. (score: 3) | This is so interesting u/LittleSayori_6 ! How did the bias manifest?

Thanks for contributing to the discussion! (score: 2) | The AI wasn't very complex and didn't work most of the time as it could only answer specific things. It wasn't a very long project, after all. In the end, it was heteronormative, transphobic, antisemite (which is made so much worse by the fact that I'm from Germany and it wasn't too long ago that this happened), and I remember feeling annoyed at how it talked about self-harm.


I didn't participate in making it, but I think they already had something to create an AI but they still needed to feed information or something? I don't know, I was simply there to test it.¬†



I hope I understood the question correctly :') (score: 1) | I'm going to go firmly against the tide and say: **yes**.

I hear what you're saying. If I'm having sleep issues, I'd rather know about it the first day I am a little groggy rather than 5 days later when I'm ready to either crash into depression, or fly into hypomania THEN crash into depression. (I have bipolar)

If I have a sudden temp increase, heart rate increase etc then I'd very much like my smartwatch to beep and remind me to do a grounding exercise (I have PTSD as well).

Lastly, if I'm wide awake at 2AM and standing at a bridge, and no one's picking up, I'd rather talk to an AI, than no one at all.

It's not a dichotomy between human mental health care and AI-based mental health care.

For some people, it's a choice between AI-based mental health care and no care at all.

I agree that this may work better for nudges and data collection than for long-term therapy.

But one use case I'd love to implement someday once I am in a better place myself, is a AI-based suicide helpline. The reason is that in my nation these helplines failed me when I needed them the most, and I don't see ANYTHING scaling to our population.

What you need to do is sit with yourself and deeply identify what makes you you and what was put on you by the externals.

I'm at a family members house and I'm spending time with my non-abusive family. For some reason for absolutely no reason I just feel really sad and cry. Not like a few tears. I full on sob, body shaking, headache, barely breathing breakdowns, for literally no reason. Does this have something to do with the anxiety and/or depression?

What bugs me the most is the stress i feel, as soon as i tried giving Moral Orel a try i just felt stressed despite the damn thing only just starting, whats the point in even watching shows anymore if i can't even feel okay with them? And yes i did try watching dark stuff just cause i wanted to be engaged, but it seems this isn't working either. What do i do when i'm at home and not working or taking walks?

439,1de223c,"2 voices in head, one is really demeaning. How to stop letting it influence me as much? ","It's been going on for a while but I have this thing where whenever I think/ do one thing, a voice inside my head criticizes me. Its pretty easy to just ignore but I do think it has affected how i express myself. It's going as I make this post right now and saying that I'm stupid for going onto reddit as if I genuinely have a problem. Please don't shame me if this is just something normal ! sorry the post is long! 

  
BTW, the voice doesn't refer to me as ""you,"" the voice is me, so for example if I'm thinking ""Wow I am so happy"" the second voice goes ""why am I so happy it really isnt that exciting""

**tldr; second voice that always humbles me and downplays my feelings so I start to believe events/feelings are not that serious.**

  
I think it might just be intrusive thoughts, but it's a little different than that. The intrusive thought affects the main voice, and then the second voice is the one that says that I'm a cornball idiot for thinking like that. So its good and bad in a way, but really only has affected me negatively



Whenever something bad happens to me, I begin to pity myself or say that I have terrible luck etc. The second voice tells myself that I'm acting stupid or that whatever happened isn't a big deal and that I'm overreacting. Same thing whenever something good happens and I'm excited, but the voice says that its not that exciting or that things are going to go bad and it won't last long

  
I am really insecure about my body and face, so sometimes I look into the mirror and just stare at my self. If i call myself ugly, the other voice doesn't speak. 

However, if I question if I have some kind of dysmorphia the voice says that its not that serious and that I'm just trying to convince myself that somethings wrong with me. I try to stare for barely 10 seconds but the whole time i'm doing that the voice says I'm being corny so i immediately feel ashamed and stop



I feel like my body is terrible (which im trying to fix) because I barely can eat 1 meal and have motivation to do things yet can never get my body to move. I genuinely wonder what is up with my body but once again the second voice just says nothing is wrong with me and that I want a reason to pity myself.

  
is the voice itself normal? i can survive fine with the voice, the health and insecurity is its own problem. 

It basically just keeps me neutral and self aware, but I think I've had a tough time trying to express myself because of this. I haven't told my parents how my body feels and always aches and how I want to wake up early but I cant, etc. I cringe at the thought of going up to my family and talking about myself as if i WANT them to tell me that im not ok ",2,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1de223c/2_voices_in_head_one_is_really_demeaning_how_to/

I have now developed strong feelings and confessed them to Maddi. Maddi said that ""things have changed"" for her too and asked what i wanted. I said thay we both delete the apps, say goodbye anyone else who is a romantic/sexual option and give ""us"" a go.

Full story:

Ok so I don't know the best way to get this out, but here we go.

There's a girl, Maddi. We dated when we were super young and it didn't work. Maddi got with Bob and had a kid.

Fast forward 10 years and Maddi and I are best friends.
Maddi left the guy due to serious Family Domestic Violance.

Maddi has moved 10 hours away from me and i have been there a few times for support.

I have been her rock. How we are both being single, we have been more and more affectionate with each other.
Holding hands, cuddles while watching movies, sleeping in the same bed and spooning.
No sex or kissing.

While all this is happening she has been talking to Mark from Tinder Mark lives 4 hours away from Maddi and they made a plan to spend 4 days in Maddi's town to see Maddi.

I have now developed strong feelings and confessed them to Maddi. Maddi said that ""things have changed"" for her too and asked what i wanted. I said thay we both delete the apps, say goodbye anyone else who is a romantic/sexual option and give ""us"" a go.

She said she isn't sure and want to talk over dinner (the 17th June). She did say that that i can consider all her dating apps deleted. I asked her about ""us"" later and said i needed an answer because waiting is making me crazy. Maddi said that she wants to clear up some thing is thats worrying her (like ruining out friendship, her kid, and stuff) and just wants to be sure.

She still had Mark come up for 4 days after i confesed my feelings. That makes me super uncomfortable as i have no idea whay they did or what they meant to each other. Maddi has told me before i confessed my feelings that Mark doesn't mean anything much to her and just dating to seeing how things go (yet she is texting him CONSTANTLY).

I will be going to see Maddi for a whole week. At the end of that week, she is travelling to the same area as Mark lives for a legal appointment (its a capital city). But Maddi isn't being too detailed and I have convinced myself Maddi is going to spend the weekend with Mark. (Reasons being she never travels far without another driver as she is a nervous driver, she isn't being specific about where and when the appointment is and it just feels wrong in my gut and maddi is probably keeping it from me to protect my feelings).

I am in limbo and it's doing my head in. I am finding myself crying, not eating, not sleeping, and unable to do anything at work.

My mind is going to the fact that Maddi and Mark are making the effort to drive 8 hour round trips to see each other and i am just sitting here - unable to do anything about it.

When Maddi and I are on the phone or texting everything is wonderful and we are great and i have no anxiety at all. But once i am at work and unable to talk to her my head spirals. When she is slow replying (outside working hours) i am questioning if she is talking to him.

I feel so anxious and i also have so much guilt that my anxiety can't help me trust her. But should intrust her. But then again, if she is single right now, I have no business to know anything about her private life.

I've known I'll start meds for a while as my situation is pretty severe but the moment he was telling me what I'll be taking I was crushed and kept thinking I was too sensitive and made him think I should take pills I don't need. I've been trying my hardest these few days to get past it and just realise they're helping me but it's killing me. I just feel insane. I'm in a horrible state these past months and have done numerous attempts so obviously they are needed since the professionals decided so. In two weeks I'll also be starting anti depressants. Do you have any advice as to how to approach this?",1,1,new,"**Hello u/!**

453,1de0aya,I push people away and I need to know how to stop running away from being close to people,"I've noticed I push people away, when we talk I simply stop myself from sharing too much, when people wanna get close to me I start feeling overwhelmed even if they just send one text message so I end up procrastinating on answering them and end up forgetting after some days. When I put myself in conversations with them I hold my opinions and reactions, I won't talk to keep the conversation going, simply because I end up feeling without energy to even try. When people flirt with me I shut them down, I tell them I'm not interested and if they insist I end up not responding after a few days.

If I'm lucky enough to have people interested in continuing to talk I show the worst in myself, my insecurities, my biases, my unpopular opinions, just trying to have them stop thinking highly of me.

I have a hard time trusting people and I make the effort but it's very easy to lose my trust and they notice I don't trust them enough so.. yeah.

When I get attached to people I end up being very needy and.. that pushes them away

All the time there is fear involved and I make people drift away from me.

I do all of these when I try to protect myself and a lot of the times I'm also thinking: ""I don't want you to get too close and get hurt by me"", ""I'm too toxic for anyone to get anything good out of being in my company"" ""it's better when I'm alone""

I'm supposed to do the opposite but it seems like it's way easier said than done, my emotions become too painful and overwhelming before I can even get close to people.",2,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1de0aya/i_push_people_away_and_i_need_to_know_how_to_stop/
454,1de05rl,Being overly emotional and just exhausted ,"  Hello! I don't really post at all on Reddit, mainly just lurking on occasion. Forgive me if my formatting is odd, this is my first post. Just wanted to see if I wasn't alone on this, but I find myself to be a really emotional person and highly sensitive to certain topics.
  First thing that comes to mind if whenever I do end up talking about my own experiences or personal thoughts, I end up crying. This has happened every time I've tried bringing up my own mental health with my mother (to no avail, my aunt is helping me get in touch with a therapist, so yippee!) And I always seem to end up in tears. Another incident that was similar was when I confined in my school counselor about my worries about not being able to graduate in time and I was barely holding back tears at the thought of having to tell my parents about it. But, when she [my school counselor] gave me support. OPEN THE FLOODGATES! I guess it's just a lot of touchy stuff, but if anyone has any tips on maybe keeping these tears in? I feel like it really doesn't help my case with my mother, if her daughter is telling her stuff through tears and hiccups.
  In the case for the exhaustion, I just can't find myself to have any energy throughout the day. Barely enough to send my friends or my girlfriend a message to response to her goodmornings. I'm thankful that she's understanding of what's going on with me and my headspace. I've always had speculations, but could this be the long term effects of depression? I'd say I've been struggling with depression since I was in middle school, but only during high-school and now that I've out I think it's gotten worse. Any tips to deal with the mental fog?
  Also I do have thoughts that I might be suffering from other things (ie ADHD, autism) how would I exactly bring that up with my therapist? I would be more than willing to do testing, what worries me are how my parents will react if I turn up with something. (For context: both my parents are Asian and both don't think really highly of mental disorders/illnesses. I catch enough flak for having anxiety.)

I recently got in contact with a psychologist in my area to seek out a psychological examination. I figured this would be the first step for my issues.

Today however, I received word from the doctor that now they're not going to authorize the service and I will have to pay the full cost if I want the evaluation. They explained that if I am able to meet with a neurologist prior and get a referral, we can then move forward. With insurance.

463,1ddz6bq,Advice before I let my eating disorder ruin my life for good. ,"I've been battling an eating disorder for about a year (became really perfectionistic about counting calories to the extreme), and it's about to ruin my life for good. During the last fall semester of freshman year in college I got anorexia due to injuring my wrist and hip and being unable to do any exercise but walking, and got even more paranoid about getting fat. That turned into binge eating constantly, and I managed to barely survive this semester. Throughout this time, I've gotten therapy sometimes multiple times a week, had so much help from my parents (emotional and financially; they've been incredibly supportive and spent so much money trying to help me). I've met with a nutritionist, I've gotten rid of food content for some time, stopped driving myself, and done tons of self reflection. I've even been doing self hypnosis. I've read every self discipline advice and have lots of knowledge, but in the end it can't seem to help me. Finally, my leg hip injury still bothers me considerably and hasn't seemed to really improve.

However, the food thoughts haven't gone away. I have a decent body fat percentage (though my parents say I look fine) and need to lose this weight fast before school starts in 2 months. I'm on an ROTC scholarship and need to have this taken care of by then, it seriously disrupted that. I am getting back from a 2 week trip to Japan with my Dad, and realized that the calories added up regardless and I allowed myself to overeat/binge at breakfast and lunch buffets today, because I wasn't feeling ""in it"" and was just thinking about food so much, and because I feel like I really failed (my chest fat is unbearable and it'll take a good bit more time to get rid of; haven't made any real progress). I already have plans of binging when I get back.

I feel pretty bad about this, but nothing seems to work for good. The thoughts are too strong, and I'm tired of feeling decent (or even just in control despite strong urges, or having it be tough but manageable). I was supposed to not eat lunch today but the hunger pang was too strong. My injuries aren't healed nor is my digestion, and since my weight has stagnated I'm not in a great places for fall. I guess I have to drop everything I've worked hard for because I need to binge.

Any advice on how to potentially beat this would be appreciated. I'm kinda hopeless right now.",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ddz6bq/advice_before_i_let_my_eating_disorder_ruin_my/

I was able to convince him that this wasn‚Äôt my intent and I wasn‚Äôt aware I came off that way. And I agreed I wouldn‚Äôt watch YouTube anymore during work. Which is fine.

Every time I start to cry, I think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm such a pussy, I have no right to cry, this is embarrassing, man up,‚Äù and I have visions of the male figures in my life disapproving of my emotional state.

I will say though i understand your concern about what those around you would think cus I did it also, my ex of 5 years never saw that side of me because as the man we have a role to play, but please understand there is nothing wrong with you crying at all.

Going straight to the point, yes, crying does help. A lot. It allows me to release all of pent up emotions and stress.especially when it‚Äôs around my GF, as she knows that I‚Äôm going through something and she‚Äôs there to support me. 

I understand why you feel that crying isn‚Äôt right, but don‚Äôt think that. Crying is normal and nobody should put you down because of it. If they do, they are heartless and they don‚Äôt understand your feelings.

In case you don‚Äôt want to cry, I‚Äôd recommend having a talk with someone. Either someone you trust, or someone who won‚Äôt judge you. Tell them about all your stress, all your feelings and anything that disturbs you. Ask them how they feel and what they think. Such honest talk allows you to get accustomed to your emotions and validate them. 

For stress I‚Äôd recommend finding a hobby and a safe space, somewhere where you don‚Äôt have to think about your problems and enjoy yourself. Whether that would be exercising in the gym, or reading books in bed. And don‚Äôt feel like you are wasting time. Relaxing and allowing yourself to rest is crucial to your wellbeing.

First and foremost, you should identify why you stalk them. Is it because of envy? Is it because you want to see them fail? I‚Äôm not judging you, I have done similar things years ago. Once you understand it, it will be easier for you to process, that stalking them is only destructive for you. 

In my opinion, you should talk with someone you trust, like a friend, or alternatively someone on the internet, who doesn‚Äôt know you and won‚Äôt judge. Talking with them can help you release emotions, helping you with accepting that their lives don‚Äôt matter to you and you can move on. 

Going to therapy is a solution, but I‚Äôd see it more of a last resort in your case. Deleting social media won‚Äôt fix you, it will maybe even worsen your condition. I again strongly recommend talking with someone and letting out all your emotions.

The best advice I have for you is this; sit with it. Embrace the hurt, the numbness, the pain, the anger, the guilt, the exhaustion, the desperation- whatever it is, and all of what it is. Healing doesn‚Äôt come until feeling does.¬†
Talk to people, let somebody know what‚Äôs going on. Don‚Äôt carry it alone. Take care of yourself, even when it‚Äôs hard. And when you can‚Äôt, get help. You‚Äôre not a burden for needing help. Try to rediscover the things you love about life, because we have the find the beauty in our world. Remember relapsing to an old mental state is not a failure, it happens sometimes and is part of healing and growing.¬†

EVERYTHING passes, even the things that seem the most endless. Face it and give it time.

You can also consider seeing a counselor if you‚Äôre not already. You can always go in for a few sessions just to see if it‚Äôs something you think would would work with you. If you‚Äôd like, I‚Äôm happy to give you any resources you‚Äôd like; there‚Äôs plenty of options even including free ones.

I've been overconsuming drugs/alcohol and I honestly felt lost the past month and a half, because I had no plan for my life and just came on a month notice and now I'm back to where I started about a year ago. I lost 3k initially neglecting my trading rules which could've been avoided, I lost another 5k in a scam when I was under the influence, thought I was getting helped and even had a chance to pull the $ out before I lost it. 

I honestly feel like this is bigger than the $, more so a reflection of my own mental state, I don't have a plan for life and don't even know what the point of making money is, I don't know what I want, know I need to work to survive, but I'm not sure where I'm going. I do feel better working and having responsibility but I feel like theres no point to my life right now. I try to start goals and I just end up at the same point because of neglecting myself, and making dumb decisions. I need to take care of my mental health but also get some direction and responsibility in life, I feel like I'm just floating with no direction. 

I always make some progress and then regress back to 0 because of stupid mistakes, I stay with good habits for a little bit, and always go back to drugs/alc, become lazy, I don't know what I want from life, I don't know how to take care of myself. 

I'm going to go back to work but even if I make $ I don't know how to avoid dumb decisions and set myself on the right path with balance.

Something that helps me with the self loathing specifically is to remind myself of all the times I could've been an absolutely horrid person (especially if it would've have been justified) and I decided not to. I also remind myself of the times I have gone out of my way to help others or to cheer others up (surprising them with a gift, calling/texting to check up on them, staying up late to be a listening ear etc.).

I'm 52 and and for 4 years I have battled with my depression but I now look in the mirror and say, you are worth it.

For me personally being in a healthier place now, it feels much more like a gremlin in the back of my mind than my own voice saying mean things. Try to build that separation between that voice and your own voice and try to remember that it‚Äôs not really you saying these negative things. Then you have to challenge them. ‚ÄúI have no friends‚Äù can be challenged by ‚Äúthere are people who like spending time with me and I can make an effort to engage with them more‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bad at everything‚Äù can be challenged by ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really overwhelmed with life right now, which is why I‚Äôm struggling to do basic things‚Äù. It might take a long time of frequently challenging these thoughts and re-framing them to be kinder on yourself but it gets easier. Then it‚Äôs easier to challenge by saying ‚ÄúI do have friends, they‚Äôre just busy right now‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually nailing this thing in my life right now‚Äù.

TlDR:  Try different ones and see what works for you. Please note they do take perseverance and are hard work.

Personally, this doesn't work, as my inner critic belittles me for taking such credit.

Mindfulness can help, so you recognise that you are having critical thoughts.
Mindfulness isn't easy and I'm only starting on the journey.

CBT works for others, but despite being highly logical, the same logic and compassion I have for others doesn't apply to me. Therefore, I fail at CBT (yes I've have CBT therapy several times).

MCBT may help.

IFS may help as it describes the inner critics as really trying to help you. It tries to get you to talk and work with your critics. You need to get into 'self'.

My therapist (provided by work), is keen on EMDR and we are starting that journey. I am aware that some people say that it is snake-oil and the pen waving bit adds nothing. I am not convinced about that part.

DBT may work and involves making a safe / happy box to keep important things in.

There is an idea that you can imagine your critic as a little person and you can put it in your pocket, so it won't talk to you. I tried that but it didn't work.
It runs counter to the arguments in several therapies that arguing with your critic doesn't work and the more you try not to think about something just makes you think of it more.

One thing that does strike me is that Mindfulness, the state of self in IFS and the visualisation of the safe / happy place in EMDR are all similar.

I'm sorry this doesn't help you directly. If there was one guaranteed method all therapists would use it. (score: 2) | I hate myself more than anything. I can hardly stand to look in the mirror. I don‚Äôt think I will ever feel differently about myself. Sucks to constantly feel worthless and disgusting. (score: 2) | Make peace with the fact that everyone is flawed, everyone makes mistakes, and that you are no exception to that. Try and find something meaningful to you that you can build on which will show growth from your attention. (score: 2) | It's hard and there's no one size fits all for self acceptance. I like to remind myself that I'm trying my best. My old friend once told me everyone around me is simply trying their best. You are struggling, but you are trying your best so give yourself that sense of grace.

I feel most self loathing when I neglect self care. Not brushing my teeth, changing my clothes, eating, etc. It really is the little acts of self love that help me change my self concept. Sometimes even just making my bed.

You are likely no better or worse than the average human. Rumination can be a mind trap, but focusing on what's outside of myself helps. Like noticing the weather or going for a walk can help to get me out of my head.

Usually something has happened in childhood that you haven't processed, situations provided lessons that you did not bring to consciousness. You should journey backwards in time, and explore the memories that may be haunting you subconsciously. Analyse the people that hurt you in your mind. Create a plan to not fall into this pit again.

It's freeing but also really painful. You may actually get worse before you get better. But the pain has more meaning, it makes sense so it's easier to deal with. I suppose you'll feel worse, but you'll feel stronger because the pain has a tangible reason for existing.

477,1ddu951,"Lost $8k due to being irresponsible, continue making bad decisions, reflecting on poor mental state","I moved to Mexico about 3 months ago with no plan, I was trying to learn trading but not that serious, I lost the concept of how important my money was and lost it due to stupid mistakes. I've been overconsuming drugs/alcohol and I honestly felt lost the past month and a half, because I had no plan for my life and just came on a month notice and now I'm back to where I started about a year ago. I lost 3k initially neglecting my trading rules which could've been avoided, I lost another 5k in a scam when I was under the influence, thought I was getting helped and even had a chance to pull the $ out before I lost it. 

I honestly feel like this is bigger than the $, more so a reflection of my own mental state, I don't have a plan for life and don't even know what the point of making money is, I don't know what I want, know I need to work to survive, but I'm not sure where I'm going. I do feel better working and having responsibility but I feel like theres no point to my life right now. I try to start goals and I just end up at the same point because of neglecting myself, and making dumb decisions. I need to take care of my mental health but also get some direction and responsibility in life, I feel like I'm just floating with no direction. 

I always make some progress and then regress back to 0 because of stupid mistakes when I'm in a poor mental state, I stay with good habits for a little bit, and always go back to drugs/alc, become lazy, I don't know what I want from life, I don't know how to take care of myself.

479,1ddtypo,My life improved like I never thought it would,"I fell into a deep hole at the beginning of 2022. I made a bad decision with my job, then made a bad decision with my relationships. This begun a cycle of avoidance with me. I‚Äôd skip out on almost anything thinking I‚Äôd make another bad decision. Then, I got into a relationship with someone after my ex just to help me forget. These things started digging the hole for me.

I‚Äôd do nothing but play video games and spend time with my gf. For work, I‚Äôd only work a job for a week then quit because I either hated it or I got sick (I got sick with various things after having a rock solid immune system my whole life). Some days I‚Äôd hardly see the sun. My house was a horrible environment as well. I share a 2 bed 1 bath with my mom and she constantly smokes cigarettes inside and has cats that pee everywhere. The air felt toxic most of the time.

One day, my dad said he‚Äôs finally in a position to help me with college. This was great news as I‚Äôd been wanting to go to college for 3 years, but couldn‚Äôt. Mainly because I never took the first step. Thankfully, my dad gave me the boost I needed. He got a house that I rent and helped me enroll.

Once classes started, it was hard to adjust to being out and about again. I used to love driving for hours, but even the 4 minute drive to campus had be paralyzed with anxiety. Being in a lecture room for any longer than 10 minutes was just as bad. I eventually opted to online classes just that semester.

Being out of the house and away from my gf made me realize that she was the reason for most of my anxieties. After dropping her, I was 90% better. The only thing left was to adjust more to being in public. That‚Äôs when I started doordashing.  Now I‚Äôm back to ‚Äúmy old self‚Äù in a sense. I‚Äôve got no anxiety anytime I do anything.

In my darkest days I thought I‚Äôd never be the same. But a change that came out of nowhere for me helped me so much with my life. A change of environment can make an insane difference",1,0,new,,
480,1ddu1xm,I Don‚Äôt Feel Real. How Do I Work At This?,"Sorry for the vague title I just can‚Äôt really express how I feel exactly.

My best attempt would probably be that, I don‚Äôt feel like I am who people think I am? I just think I‚Äôm absolutely abhorrent, and I wonder why people want to be around me.

I‚Äôve been battling back and forth in my head about cutting friends off because in my head I rationalise it as me keeping my moping to myself and keeping them from what I deem to be toxic behaviours in myself. I try to refute them but then I just rationalise it all over. 

Occasionally I‚Äôll get this feeling of breathlessness, like I feel my heart sink when I consider that perhaps my friends lives would genuinely be better without me, I stop to consider what I offer them and I come up blank every single time.

I respect my friends agency and their choice to be friends with me but I just can‚Äôt shake the feelings and I really feel like I need to say, something. Recently I did have a small argument with some friends and I claimed I felt ‚Äúinfantilised‚Äù but really I was just working back from a conclusion and obfuscating the point. 

I mean this may be small but it‚Äôs gotten to the point that if I see myself in a mirror and think ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt look too bad‚Äù I feel genuinely disgusted with myself, I guess in short I just really hate myself. I can‚Äôt explain why, even now I hate that I‚Äôm writing this and I feel like I‚Äôm pushing a burden onto others, so apologies for that.

I feel I should note I don‚Äôt have feelings of self-harm or suicidal notions but I do often consider self imposed social isolation. Blocking friends, avoiding physical meetings etc. I just think it‚Äôs best if I am kept away from others. 

So I guess the main question is, how can I begin to fix this?

483,1ddt7vh,"I lost someone to suicide and bc of that I became a bad friend, does that make me a bad person?","I have lost someone close to me by suicide, we can call them A. After A died I started analysing what I did wrong or how I could have prevented their death. I worried a lot about other people in my life who also suffer from mental health problems. I could not afford to lose anyone else. I tried to be a good friend and listened to their problems while not burdening them with my grief. About one month after the funeral one of my friends who we can call B had a really bad day so I tried to be there for them. We texted a lot during the day, but things got worse and worse. B started saying that they wanted to die. Then they stopped responding. I called and called. No answer. My worst nightmare started to become reality. After a while B texted me back. They where alive.

After that night our friendship changed. At a time where I needed support I forced myself to be the support of others. But I did not have any choice really.  B might have died if I wasn't there for them. After what happened I begged B to get help but they didn't want to. (They said they would get therapy, and I offered to help them get an appointment. But it didn't happen untill several months later.) I worried all the time, I felt helpless. I was not only worried about B, I have a handful of other people who also was at risk of dying by suicide. I think i didn't grieve properly because of the responsibility of keeping others alive. I  ended up getting depressed and dropping out of collage. 

After some time on antidepressants I still felt like shit but good enough to get back to collage. I tried to stay friends with B. But sometimes I got anxiety after hanging out with them. Sometimes so bad that I wanted to hurt myself (sometimes I did). But other times it was fine, but never as good as it used to be. After some time, I became scared to spend time with B because i did not know how I would feel afterwards. And after a lot of contemplating I desided to end cut ties with B. 

I do not feel good about it. A lot of the time I feel like a bad person. From Bs perspective they reached out when struggling and then lost a friendship. If they struggle with suicidal thoughts again I doubt they will ask for help again because of how I handled it afterwards. I wish I could have been a better friend. I am still scared B will die.

To give a bit more information about myself i consider myself to be introverted and reserved, not very communicative, i've been in a lot of pain for a lot of years so i've also became very bitter and negative even though i try to not show it, i think i'm average looking i could look better but i've been very depressed lately.I wasn't always like this i had very high grades for the most part of my life last year i got a 9 in almost all my finals and lost 16kg and now i'm at a normal weight. I kind of blame me for being this way but at the same time i was never given a chance by life to become the person other people wanted me to be, i would like to be more open and communicative but if other people don't want to interact with me i don't want to insist.Are this reasons enough for never being liked by anyone?",15,21,new,"Unfortunately, a lot of ppl don‚Äôt like quiet and shy ppl.

I think if you spend such a long time without socializing on a regular basis and then try to immediately make friends, you won't get good results, which is annoying because in order to get good at socializing you have to consistently socialize which is kinda redundant, but yeah. 

It's not a you problem, because there are plenty of terrible people who still have friends... Honestly, I also believe that a lot of people may appear social or extroverted but a lot of people in our generation are lonelier than ever, there are a lot more self-conscious people nowadays who are also having the same thoughts as you (me included).

My dear, you are going through something which at some point, all of us go through. It is a moment in which we are faced with a choice: us or other people. The lesson here is to realise that your life is YOURS to live, not the other people's. 

You yourself in your post give us a perfect summary of your life so far: ""...I was never given a chance by life to become the person other people wanted me to be..."" and THAT IS A GOOD THING!!! You've always been protected by fate from becoming something which is an abomination of you, someone who fits at the table which rejects them. We ARE NOT meant to become a person other people want us to be, we ARE meant to become who WE want to be, who we feel in our heart is our true self.

When you don't have a seat at a table, never force to try to sit at it still. Create your own table instead. In practice, it is done through learning to love yourself and thus, creating a world around you that you yourself want to live in and choose to live in. Yes, for a while it is always a world in which we are only by ourselves, but in time, we always inevitably attract those kind of people who admire us and our world and cherish us truly. 

My dear, you are chasing after the validation from people who do not deserve it at all. My advice for you is to shift your focus on yourself, in order to earn the validation from you first and foremost. Prove to yourself that you are who you feel that you are. It is ok to choose you as you are the main character of your life üòä You are a far better person than you think that you are and it is finally time for you to go on a journey of self-discovery in order to realise it üòâ Much love to you ‚ù§Ô∏è (score: 2) | Dishonesty, distrustful, disrespectful, (score: 1) | lol, I don't know, I don't really have friends to begin with. (score: 1) | i think there‚Äôs a difference between being dislikeable and not finding it easy to make friends

i was also bullied in elementary school and no one liked me at all, but that was because i have adhd and was an annoying little shit lol

but there have been plenty of people in my life who have been completely fine as human beings but our personalities just didn‚Äôt click so the friendship fell off, i don‚Äôt dislike them, we‚Äôre just not great as friends, we just didn‚Äôt share the same hobbies or humor and hanging out just didn‚Äôt feel great, it wasn‚Äôt either of our faults it just is what it is

personally i find myself hanging around people who i think are funny and who i share hobbies or activities with.

i think it might be good to join on campus clubs, it can feel awkward to hang out with someone just to hang out, it can feel easier to make friends with people who you actively do things with, in class it can be awkward to talk to people because everyone‚Äôs kind of focusing on their own things but in clubs and such you‚Äôre usually all working together towards a shared goal so i think you might find it easier to find friends there

also getting a job somewhere is also a pretty good way to make friends if there are no good options for clubs (score: 1) | Maybe you should go see someone you can talk to about your past? (a psycologist/ therapy) I think it is easier that they can help you in person, then hundreds of comments on the internet.

(score: 1) | I'm sorry I don't have the energy to write a longer answer but I think a lot of people dislike me because I'm autistic and/or they are intimidated by my silence or knowledge. For example if I share something I know that I find exciting, they think I think I'm better than them?? But yeah I keep asking myself the same question because people never like me as soon as they meet me. If I am not scared of talking back they dislike me even more. (score: 1) | I don't think this is the case with you but I can tell you why I think I am mostly left alone.

I have done a lot of self reflection during the decades. I stopped talking bad about people behind their backs. Soon I noticed that my stocks went down at workplace.

Then I noticed that I lost the ability to lie. I just can't tell even social lies and I go silent if that's expected from me. Stocks down again. 

Thirdly I have been a very unique person all my life when it comes to interests. I'm female but somewhere between genders, not very feminine but not very ""male"" either when talking about topics I find interesting. I've usually had more common with men but men mostly don't wish to have women as friends.

Then there are my own reasons. I'm quite picky, and I'm sure people can notice when I can't agree with their views, even though I remain silent. I don't want to judge people's opinions or argue, so I don't know what to say when I strongly disagree with someone's values. Usually I just start to avoid them. 

Four valid reasons there, no solution in sight. (score: 1) | I know why it was happening to me - I am AuDHD

And even if they don‚Äôt, it doesn‚Äôt matter because you will and that‚Äôs enough. (score: 1) | Hello üëã,

You expect people to invite you or to be sprung on you, you have to just keep making an effort if they've already allowed a chance to participate with them socially. 

The blaming life thing is embodied and projected in your actions and words. It's good that you have kinda your fault, it's probably all your fault but none of us are perfect so just keep progressing, fix your faults, don't be ashamed of certain one, and accept certain ones.

The step sibling part is maybe a personal comparison *oh they're better than me because....*¬π but unnecessary, maybe even resentful socially.

1. Not because of being loved, or gifted, or spoiled, etc... it's because of some work, practice or technique.

How do you think your idea character is? Like if you had to make up an imaginary role model, based on you scrutinizing everything you've learned about peoples behavior so far, what would they be like? What do you need to practice to get there? (score: 1) | Find the right crowd you‚Äôll fit right in (score: 1) | Hi, I hope this finds you well...
I don't think there is anything that makes people dislike one another unless they have done some nasty stuff...

But what I can say is, depending on the energy someone is radiating on the outside, people will feel comfortable or uncomfortable enough to approach or befriend a stranger...

And as human beings we tend to share the type of energy that is in our everyday environment...

And depending on what you said, it seems like you live in an environment that makes you feel unwanted and/or unloved... And I don't how that works, but people will feel that energy around you and tend to avoid you....

So my main advice is change the environment you are living in, do some work on yourself, learn how to love yourself and grow more your self confidence.

A good friend will learn about whatever conditions you have and find ways to work around and through whatever challenges your mental health brings. They will set clear limits to what they‚Äôll get involved with and have clear boundaries so you know when to give them space or whatever the need is. 

It‚Äôs also critical for all of us to have a few people we can trust and lean on. This way no one friend is the only support we have.

While my ‚Äúworld‚Äù is abandoned, and now when I‚Äôm alone I‚Äôm felling it as never before. I barely have couple of friends that are thousand kilometers/miles away. Other hobbies that I have are not giving any feeling of satisfaction at all. 

As my psychologist told me, I have to help my world to grow. Slowly, steadily, water it like a plant. Start with the small things. Start finding the support first. It might be empathic friend, it‚Äôs much easier when you are a girl. Or talk to your parents. Then you will slowly create your circle of friends, common interests. Don‚Äôt be scared to be different, to have a different opinion, it‚Äôs actually what makes your friendship thrive.

Well, that might be advice from ME to ME too. Since I‚Äôm at the very low now. And just found this Reddit community dedicated to me and my fellow friends within our sinking fleet.

509,1ddu4um,Traumatic experience with injured wildlife,"A beautiful buck deer was hit on the road by my house and the person didn't even stop. His back leg was broken, compound fracture and he didn't seem able to walk. I dragged him on my property out of the middle of the road in a blanket. A person who stopped said they were calling the police. However, no one came. I landed up calling wildlife rehabber who told me the deer might recover because he was overall not otherwise injured and they can sometimes recover broken bones. The rehabber told me to watch it and see if it moved. However, I think maybe his other back leg was also injured because he did not get up or move around. The deer landed up being swarmed by flies, so the rehabber said I could cover it with a blanket. I called animal control and fish and wildlife but no one was of help and no one came. They don't do rehab and the literal only option is to have police come and shoot it. Ultimately this is what happened, right in my yard. It was horrific because the creature seemed to trust me and had his head up and kept staring into the house before this. 

I feel like I completely betrayed this animal. It brings me back to when I recently lost my beloved dog to hemangiosarcoma. All day I have felt dead inside and am questioning the meaning of life. I feel like maybe I should have let nature take its course. Who are we to say what the animal wants. I don't think I would want to be shot dead with a gun. I am very attached to animals, feel immensely for their suffering and am not convinced shooting a deer is at all humane. I could not watch so I do not know how in pain he was and how long he stayed alive after. The whole thing feels so cruel and horrible and pointless. I know a lot of people might think it is silly about a deer, but I am a vegan and found this whole experience painful",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ddu4um/traumatic_experience_with_injured_wildlife/

My bf and I both spoke with an officer separately and even though I felt a lot of embarrassment and shame i thought it‚Äôs over and I just need to use my tools and we both need to learn from this and start actively managing our anxiety better. Fast forward to today several weeks later and a lady that works in the building comes up to me and says she needs to talk to me and I‚Äôm already anxious because I don‚Äôt enjoy talking to this woman. She proceeds to say the cops were called  because I was screaming help me (which I did not say I was saying you‚Äôre hurting me because he was holding my arms after I said I was going to end my life; also trust me I know how this all sounds which is adding to my anxiety üòû) so I‚Äôm just basically like I already talked to the cop and I don‚Äôt want to talk about it with you because nothing happened. Again I‚Äôm fully aware how this sounds and I‚Äôm not able to speak more coherently to her because she basically just accosted with this information literal weeks after the event. Then she makes a thinly veiled threat to my bf who is not present that he is not on my lease and he needs to keep it down. And I‚Äôm just standing there mouth agape barely processing what is happening. Like not only was I not able to elaborate on a very complex and nuanced situation but I‚Äôm also being painted in a certain light that I‚Äôm far from comfortable about. After this she tries to make it about how she cares about me which if you met her and knew what she was like you would understand she does not. I am now perseverating on who thinks I‚Äôm being abused and aware that to the outside looking in it seems like I‚Äôm in a dv situation and that makes me sick to my stomach. They didn‚Äôt see my bf also helping me breathe when I was hyperventilating and holding me while I shook. It‚Äôs not fair that we both gave our matching accounts to a police officer and haven‚Äôt had any incidents before or after and this is how I‚Äôm treated and how my bf is being treated. Not to mention that he is the one responsible for paying rent and that we both have spoken to management together and because of that assumed they didn‚Äôt care that he wasn‚Äôt on the lease. I am at an absolute loss of what to do and I‚Äôm just trying to regulate my emotions and my bf is doing the same. I‚Äôm not even sure I want advice but it does feel good to release this from my brain. ,1,3,new,"**Hello u/!**

516,1ddtity,Struggling with life and what it brings me 19m,"I‚Äôm having a very hard time right now in life. I was arrested on a reckless driving charge and ordered to do 24 hours of community service which isn‚Äôt a lot but while working 48 hours a week and having no car makes it hard to get those hours in. I‚Äôve been completely procrastinating completing those hours for the 6 months given to me to complete it. I did get to complete those hours with an organization but turns out the court does not accept those hours from that organization (doesn‚Äôt meet their standards). And now I‚Äôm left with only 5 days to get another 24 hours of community service. No other organizations that were listen by the court offer court appointed community service anymore and I have no other options left. I don‚Äôt want to go back to jail, I mentally cannot get arrested again, I can‚Äôt do that again. I work in a hospital as a OR CMA tech and am under constant emotional stress while working on patients and it‚Äôs taking such a toll with combining all of this with work. 

With all of that, I also want to say I‚Äôm a serial liar. I‚Äôve lied my entire life to make myself look interesting and cool, ever since I was a kid no one liked me for who I was and or anything about me, so when I realized I could become someone else by lying I did. I lied about rowing for team USA in rowing, even though I did row but only for a high school team. I‚Äôve lied I‚Äôve worked at prestigious hospitals and helped operate in patients even though cmas do not have those types of skills, I‚Äôve lied I was a bad ass kid in high school messing with the wrong people and coming on top. I‚Äôve lied about being a really cool rally racer even though I just liked driving off road in my previous car a ford fiesta. I‚Äôve made my self look like a completely different person and I know the lies will catch up with me one day. 

All my friend around me won‚Äôt understand my feeling or will help me which lead me to write this to tell my true story no one will ever here. I don‚Äôt know what will happened if the court finds out I didn‚Äôt complete the community service hours.

I have severe bipolar disorder that I am very good at bottling it up, I appear as a very calm person but what people don‚Äôt see is me punching walls breaking my belongings and beating myself up or just existing. I get overly mad for things that happen to me. 

One of my breaking points in my life was when in highschool my ex showed up to my house telling me she was dying and needed me to come outside to talk. I did and her friend shot me with a nerf gun (for senior assassin). She had brought 5 people along with her and film the entire thing. Including the part where I slam the door and punch a hole through the wall in my house while yelling.

Idk what to do, idk how long I can live like this ",1,1,new,"**Hello u/!**

Just curious about your specific situation (score: 4) | what OP means to say is, that even more unpleasant tastes like ""bitter"" have SOME people who like them, and i assume OP considers themselves totally unlikable so that EVERYONE avoids them?

but as for the question, OP, how can anyone of us know and answer you that. we dont know you at all. (score: 3) | Hard to say without getting to know you or your life better and speaking to a therapist is probably the best resource from that standpoint. Someone who can invest an impartial, outside observation and help you process some of the more difficult emotions would be more helpful. 

I can say that words like ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù and ‚Äúalways‚Äù are common among people who have mood disorders. We can fall prey to all-or-nothing thinking which is usually attached to feelings we have that don‚Äôt get resolved. My wife does this while driving through a parking lot. She‚Äôll see someone walking or driving by and register their face as angry or judgmental, but in reality it‚Äôs a neutral face.

Her own fears and anxieties are registering on other people who are not expressing any particular emotion. I‚Äôm not knowledgeable about autism, but I‚Äôve heard that this is something autistic people struggle with since they don‚Äôt register emotional responses well. This can lead to inappropriate conversations which turns people off.

Others may overload people in conversation. Since my wife struggles with ADHD she tends to dump everything on me, because she is afraid that she might forget her point or the other random thoughts she has. It can be overwhelming and other people can dump in other ways too. Sometimes we dump emotional things onto people when they are not ready or up to the challenge, so it can be overloading people making them feel tired or uncomfortable. 

Learning to regulate that and ask for permission is a skill that can be improved with education and practice. 

There could be other reasons that you feel like people are distancing themselves from you. But the only way to get a good answer is to have someone who knows you take a look at your behaviors. There is likely some dysfunction causing distortions that are preventing you from connecting behaviors together and getting some help with that is key to understanding how to correct for that. (score: 2) | It's impossible for everyone to hate you. Most people have no feelings one way or another. The rest may dislike or be neutral towards you.

(score: 1) | I've certainly felt this way before and still do sometimes.

Our own minds can be very mean to us, thinking we need protection from things we really don't. 

Peoples' distance and 'bolting' may be nothing more than their own shit or busy schedule.

521,1ddt3w4,I hated growing up in my rich family,"I grew up in a very wealthy family, and I hated it. Before I say anything, I want to clarify: I acknowledge the privilege and benefits that come with money. I'm grateful for the comfort my parents provided, and I'm not taking anything for granted, including having a roof over my head, good healthcare, and education. I also understand that one can experience poverty and have abusive parents simultaneously, and money didn‚Äôt cause my parents to be the way they are. I just want to make this clear so I don‚Äôt seem like a spoiled brat.

The reason I want to share this is that I‚Äôve never felt I could talk about my financial background without being judged. Maybe this will help.

My parents built their fortune from the ground up, coming from poor backgrounds to owning a successful healthcare clinic chain. Since I was a baby, they wanted me to take over the family business and study law, economics, or medicine. They wanted the best for me, but I never had any interest in taking over the business. I have ADHD, I'm terrible with numbers and organizing, and I hate nepotism. I believe many others could do a better job than me.

I always felt that the business and money were more important than me. My parents were only concerned about my academic performance and didn't care about how I felt. They would get mad if I spent time with friends or pursued my passion for dancing, seeing these activities as a waste of time. They worked long hours and had a terrible relationship with each other. I made it clear from age 12 that I had no interest in the business, pursued a degree in marketing, worked as a barista, and now work in a marketing agency while trying to dance professionally.

Since childhood, my parents told me I was a failure and should be embarrassed by my lack of achievements. They constantly reminded me that I would be nothing without them. Money ruined my childhood. I grew up with babysitters, as my parents were always working, and they were verbally abusive and controlling. I had issues with self-harm from the age of 6. 

It confuses me when people find out who my parents are and tell me how lucky I am. Even if I shared my background, I always felt labeled as ""the rich kid."" I just wish I had some societal empathy.",2,3,new,"I don't see this as being bratty. My mother was a single mother, and for some years of my childhood we were loaded. This later went to shit bc of her mental health and we lived the rest of my upbringing in relative poverty. In the years we were wealthy, she was completely abscent due to constant working. When she then became unable to work, she was present constantly. She was not a better parent bc of that, but I know I would have had an even worse childhood had she still been chasing money and the achievements that come w it. When she had to give all of that up, she also stopped pressuring me and was much more willing to listen and nurture my genuine interests. So I understand what you mean, and I'm sorry your parents weren't able to be the loving support system you needed. It really doesn't matter why they were that way, but the impact it had on you is the important part.

any time i brought up how they were making me feel my dad would often say ‚Äúwell we have a pool you should be grateful‚Äù sir us having a pool that i haven‚Äôt even touched since i was 12 because i was sick of it being used against me does not negate the fact that i get screamed at almost every night at by your wife and if its not me getting screamed it its either you or my brother, how can you not see how screwed up things are? your wife has issues that i dont think she can deal with alone and youre covering your ears and humming until you dont have to think about it anymore

side note: my dad would defend my mom more than my mom would, when my mom would freak out at me usually the undertone was just that, that she was freaking the hell out and didn‚Äôt know how to calm herself down and would lash out verbally or physically due to that, but my dad had Stockholm syndrome 9000 or something and he would always try to tell me that it was my fault that she was acting that way, he would defend her behaviors even when she herself would say that she wasn‚Äôt in the right to be acting that way

i was abused by them, mostly mentally/verbally but at times physically as well, but i felt like i couldn‚Äôt say anything about it because i was rich and i should be grateful for what i had, i dressed like shit and barely took care of myself partially because i felt like i didn‚Äôt deserve any of the good parts of growing up in a rich family

She said to me: *""well, everybody is using the word ""trauma"" nowadays for everything. I don't think you are traumatized tbh. Trauma is something completely different e.g. an earthquake etc.""*

I was so confused. I was diagnosed with five mental illnesses (especially my **severe** anxiety would not let me live properly). I'm literally unable to work for years bcs its so severe.. but I'm trying!

I'm just confused and wanted to have an opinion from you guys, because I always thought I'm a traumatized person I mean otherwise I would not have these issues I guess.

The main cause for my illnesses were mostly ***abuse, being left out, emotional unavailable mom and other family members***. well ok I luckily never experienced physical abuse but the mental abuse my family and some friends caused me over my lifetime is insane. I never ever felt good enough and felt just so so unworthy. it haunts me until today. So, if this is not trauma, what is it?",2,6,new,"I think sometimes we get hung up on the words or the diagnosis. We use the language we have to try to communicate experiences so we‚Äôre all on the same page with things. Ultimately maybe the word trauma isn‚Äôt as important as what you and your therapist choose to do moving forward to help you get better.  It‚Äôs also possible you two aren‚Äôt a good fit and that‚Äôs ok. You can hopefully find someone you‚Äôre comfortable with. It does seem like you had incidents in your past that are worth working through in therapy though. Your feelings are valid for sure. (score: 4) | I have heard many therapists discuss ‚Äúbig T trauma and little t trauma‚Äù. This was out of line, or at least very indelicate. I feel like so many people just have gotten the lowest level/least specialized therapy training possible and are saturating the market because of the insane demand. Find someone else.

Edit to add: trauma is subjective. It is never about *what* happened, it‚Äôs about how your mind and body processed (or didn‚Äôt) the experience. If you are suffering, no one can refute that. Your feelings are completely valid. (score: 3) | And to be clear, the therapists I‚Äôve worked with are primarily PsyD+ and/or in a research setting, so I feel like they are held to a much higher standard than, say, a web therapist might be. (score: 2) | First I wanna say your feelings are valid and anxiety is hard. I deal with it too, am on meds and in therapy, and it‚Äôs still hard some days. I deal with depression too, and I‚Äôm sure a couple of other undiagnosed things. Mental health is a journey of self discovery.

Part of what I think your therapist meant was that you do not meet the clinical definition of ‚Äútraumatized.‚Äù The DSM V has medical definitions for disorders and I‚Äôm sure trauma is in there somewhere, with very specific qualifiers for what it means to be diagnosed with trauma.

On the other hand, I think what your therapist was touching on too is the idea of victimization. A lot of people in today use ‚Äútrauma‚Äù as a way to justify behavior that does not serve them. Victimhood can morph into a personality/state of mind that traps us in bad habits/cycles. A lot of people don‚Äôt recognize, or choose to ignore, that trauma can be overcome and that it is possible to become a ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù on the other side.

Not all traumas are created equal, but that doesn‚Äôt mean your trauma isn‚Äôt real to you. Abandonment and neglect are real fears (I had similar experiences growing up), and these fears impact us in our day to day as adults. Hence the reason we go to therapy, to try and fix it. However, we have to find ways to move past that trauma and overcome it so that we do not continue to live in the bad moment (ie, letting trauma control our lives at present). It‚Äôs not easy. I‚Äôm still ‚Äú
unlearning things and struggle to let go of my experiences/traumas too. Yet, more and more I feel detached from the things I once viewed as trauma and now see as a blip in my life.

I think it may be worth going into your next session and asking your therapist to expand on what they meant and let them know how it made you feel. That can give you clarity on their intentions with their statement; keep an open mind in the conversation, but if you do feel they are erring the line of shutting you down or really not hearing what you are there to address, it‚Äôs perfectly okay to switch to someone else. 

I hope this is helpful. I‚Äôm only trying to play a little devils advocate and interpret what your therapist meant. I could be off the mark. But best of luck to you üíõ (score: 1) | I think because of the overuse of the word ""trauma"",  many therapists have been very wary with clients self-diagnosing ""trauma"".  I can see why though - it has watered down the term and those with trauma based diagnosis are often pushed aside.

Having said that, all trauma is valid - it is about how it affected you. It is still mostly true that the most severe trauma will lead to the most severe mental illnesses. That doesn't mean that those with less severe symptoms don't deserve support and care. Many therapists are not versed in trauma- most took the easy road and  just learnt CBT. While it can be helpful (there is trauma CBT now, but pretty new), conventional CBT doesn't ask for the ""why"" but the ""how to change your behaviour"". So it is important to figure out what kind of therapist you need. 

Going back to the severity question: you are talking about childhood trauma. There is an excellent test that is called the ACEs test. It is free, online and is actually really good at pointing you in the direction of if you have trauma and what that means for your body and mind.

So there is no ""trauma"" as a diagnosis. There are several illnesses that are purely trauma based though, mainly PTSD, C-PTSD and DID (/OSDD). (Mind you, C-PTSD is in the ICD but not the DSM. ). They all have diagnostic criteria that you have to meet. None of these criteria specify the trauma - in PTSD it is about a single traumatic event. In C-PTSD it is about complex long-term abusive situations where there was no way out. In DID it is a compartmentalisation of traumatic memories. Does DID mean most severe trauma? Yeah, most of the time. But that doesn't mean that everyone else on the trauma spectrum doesn't deserve support. 

Additionally, A lot of personality disorders are based on interpersonal trauma (especially in the form of emotional neglect) -BPD and AvPD for instance.

So I think it would be good for you to look into ACEs, look up the different trauma related disorders and see if the sort of therapist you need, is the one you are seeing now. If you don't fit the trauma disorder umbrella, you can still take the road of psycho dynamic therapy where childhood and the struggles now is also central. If you feel you are on the PD track, look up DBT. If you think you could have C-PTSD, look up a trauma therapist.

525,1ddsnxs,Desperate and need advice,"Hey guys, I need some insight for the time being concerning my mental health (seeing a counselor in a couple days and looking for psychiatry appointment too). I‚Äôm really freaked out and have never been a worse mental state.

To try to keep it brief, I got Covid for the the first time in 2021 and had some trouble breathing which triggered some anxiety (I don‚Äôt have GAD), but when the Covid was gone I felt all better. Then I got Covid again, and was prepared for the anxiety this time but also developed a hyper-awareness of my breathing. The months following I would have intrusive thoughts about my breathing that I tried really hard to suppress. Well, that worked for a couple of months but was still bothersome to me. 

Fast forward to last week, I was on vacation with my family and on Monday night I took a delta-8 10 mg gummy (I‚Äôve done regular edibles a handful of times). I actually had a really good trip. My sister was upset she missed out on the fun and we took one again the next night, this time I was way less high but had no negative affects. I don‚Äôt know if this is relevant but I wanted to include it just in case. 

On my vacation this hyperawareness of my breathing became so intense that I started to worry. I thought to myself, ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm not the only one who struggles with this‚Äù and I looked it up (this was Friday night). Somatic OCD was the first result and realizing I might have it sent me into a mind blowing panic attack. I stopped eating for 3 days and was throwing up/ dry heaving non stop. I went to ER and by this point I was disassociating and was have seizure-like compulsions. They gave me anti anxiety and a sedative that put me to sleep. When I woke up the next morning I felt really tired and tried to go work. My anxiety started to skyrocket at work and I couldn‚Äôt function. I picked up my Xanax prescription and it helped me calm down for a bit and went back to work and felt okay for the rest of the night. This morning I knew I couldn‚Äôt make it through work without the Xanax and so I took one before I left and had a pretty good day at work. As soon as i felt my medicine wear off I began to skyrocket and have extreme anxiety again, what felt like rolling panic attacks. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm terrified I will never feel normal again. It‚Äôs been a week today since I took the second gummy so I am totally unsure if it‚Äôs related. I‚Äôm scared of losing my job, I haven‚Äôt been able to do a single house chore, and feel the most terrified I‚Äôve ever been. Does anyone have any insight or advice until I can be seen by a professional?

He's done stuff like punching my little brother in the nose and giving him a nosebleed or picking me up by the shirt and slamming me against the wall. He is a kind man, but somewhat unpredictable. Like, when he is angry he'll make threats like I'll break your legs or I'll knock you out. I'm so angry and so afraid all the time. Also, though I live in a nice upper-middle class suburban neighborhood now but my family struggled before then. We had problems with our money and living situation. We moved maybe 6 or 7 times because rent was too high to the point where we had to buy the house from our grandma because we couldn't afford the current apartment we were living in. It was old and messed up, which eventually led us to spending some time living at a hotel. I am extremely grateful for my parents and their sacrifices but, these events have made a me a somewhat timid person. Though we are much better now, I still feel very alone and out of place. I don't want to act like my household is terrible all the time because it is not. But I feel the need to run to escape. It's a strong urge that I feel like a fight or flight response. And I get nervous over little things all the time. We act like nothing we experienced ever happened which makes me even angrier. All this stuff has turned me somewhat cold. My siblings call me this sometimes and can be afraid of me and express this. Because I'm ashamed to admit I've take this anger and fear out in things in bad ways. Like unaliving animals. I don't do this anymore. And I don't enjoy it, but I also don't feel any guilt from it. I am afraid of myself sometimes and how far I'm willing to go. Deep down I am compassionate, but basic emotion and compassion is not my strong suit. I did this because I needed to feel strong. I needed something to understand the way I felt. I wanted to be the one with the power. It was an escape for my anger. People at school only increase these feelings. Sometimes people will laugh at me, talk about me, and make fun of me. They sit there and laugh at my with smiles on their faces and say I'm weird and say that I stare to much or there is something wrong with me. I want to be kind I want to feel, but I am not capable of it on the level everyone else seems to be. I want to do something, but I can't. (Just so you know, I won't take my anger out on them like as a school shooter or anything. I don't want to kill people. ) I want to be strong and I need a place to take this anger. I'm afraid and I hate feeling weak. I can't allow people to disrespect me and if I don't people will continue to walk all over me even though I'm laid back and not looking for trouble. The only response I can think of is violence and I know that will get me no where. Fighting for me when I was younger was normal and encouraged. I don't think there is anything wrong with it because it is just the culture I have been influenced by because of my family and where they come from, but I know it is not always the answer.

528,1ddrnto,How to learn a language associated with trauma?,"Hey there!

For some context:

When I was a child, my family moved to a German speaking country. Now I'm not going to go into details, but I was abused by various individuals, especially those who were supposed to teach me German.

This culminated in me having panic attacks whenever I heard German being spoken. Ultimately stopping any chances I would've had at learning the language.

After 12 years, I managed to leave that country, with basic - intermediate German knowledge.

The issue is that I will probably move to another country where German is the primary spoken language, but I won't be able to converse or have a normal life if I can't learn this language. Every time I try my trauma surfaces and I can't focus.

530,1ddmfy0,How do I stop dissociating?,"I was in an extremely abusive relationship for 5 years and during that time I believe I was dissociating for the majority of the relationship. If it helps at all I am autistic as well as have ADHD. I plan on going to see a psychologist here soon again as soon as I have the money for it. 

The trouble I‚Äôm having is that I believe I am still dissociating at times, but possibly don‚Äôt know I am doing it. What freaks me out is that my brain ‚Äúreplaces‚Äù uncomfortable memories with positive interactions. That is the best way for me to describe it. I actually don‚Äôt know if that is considered dissociation or something else. 

An example:

During my abusive relationship my ex had to remove some flowers that I loved and would tend to every day. He HAD to get rid of them it wasn‚Äôt something that he was doing to intentionally hurt me. When I say I loved those flowers I mean I LOVED them. I didn‚Äôt have much left that was mine at the time. From my recollection I told him I understood and helped him do the stuff that had to be done and I was fine with it. Fast forward a year or so later he brings up the time I had the ‚Äúextreme meltdown‚Äù over the flowers. I tell him I didn‚Äôt have a meltdown I was fine with it and understood why. He is adamant that I had a meltdown and at that point I thought maybe he was just gaslighting me. Well I‚Äôm talking to my mom the next day and tell her about him saying I had a meltdown‚Ä¶well she confirms that I did in fact have a meltdown. 

I still to this day have no memory of a meltdown and in fact have a distinct memory that everything went fine.

Now back to the current time. I‚Äôve been out of that relationship for 4 years now and have been in a great healthy relationship for a little over two years. When I get stressed with work and life I find myself discovering that it‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôm doing what I did before. My partner will say something happened and my memory of it is different.

I am surrounded by a proper community of family and friends with whom I have built very strong and genuine, loving relationships with in the past few years. I have been blessed with work opportunities to do what I am truly passionate about doing. 

But it feels as though a switch has gone off and I am told by those who are the closest to me that I am acting unlike myself. My emotions feel incredibly dysfunctional, and I can tell myself that I am not centered. 

The simplest way to put it is that I have gone from being very lighthearted and free spirited to very negative. I complain about everything or feel numb/could care less about anything. I care very little for potentially building new friendships and even in social settings, regardless if related to work, I don‚Äôt engage in conversation or entirely seclude myself physically. Then suddenly I‚Äôll be super positive, back to my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù self, laughing and joking around as if I‚Äôve done a mental 180 within the next hour or within the next day. Only for that to completely regress into a heightened emotional outburst that can be quite aggressive verbally due to being ‚Äútriggered‚Äù or stressed/angry about something. Doesn‚Äôt have to even be major, just enough for me to be ticked off. 

It‚Äôs exhausting and unlike me and I see how it is toxic and exhausting to those around me. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happened, but it‚Äôs beginning to make me think very bad things about myself despite everything in my life being a dream come true. I can tell something‚Äôs wrong, but I‚Äôm having trouble catching myself and fixing it. My emotions tend to overpower my logical thought.

This might be long so bear with me. So my problem began over 2 months ago and it's been making me crazy. Over 2 months ago I heard this bizarre story on YouTube through a story narration channel. You know those channels where they use AI voice to read stories that are written in reddit formats. With the #s for algorithm and no source provided of the original author. Anyways when I found this particular story my gut kept telling me not to view it but curiosity got the better of me and I did and well, it went down hill. Firstly, I started looking for the source of this story and saw that it was nowhere on Reddit or any other platform. Nobody in the comments could provide a link or confirm if the story ever existed on Reddit. Now, I'm 100% sure the story is fake and was never on Reddit. It has a lot of inconsistencys and plot holes and the premise itself is bizarre. But the problem was that I became obsessed with it. To the point I sort manifested myself as the main character. I started to feel their emotions which were heartbreak, pain, anxiety, betrayal etc. all of these emotions are overwhelming me and I'm sick of it. I wake up in the morning sad and I often get triggers. I picture some of the characters in people around me. And it makes things worse. Even in the last few weeks I was able to thin it down and get over it a bit but my mind keeps relapsing and in the last couple of days it has become hard. I came here because I was very overwhelmed and didn't know what to do.

Now let me give a brief about the story in question. It is a story about a guy who's girlfriend suddenly dissapeard and 5 years later he found out that she had ran off with his brother to Canada and had started a family and his own family( parents, relative's) knew about it and kept it a secret. I know a bizarre plot but the story has a lot of problems such as it has very little relationship dynamics, it has a lot of details missing line the OP never mentioned the comments because if it was a real post people would have asked a lot of questions and the story ends on a weird note which just creates a lot of questions. I don't know why I became obsessed with it because I've red worser stories than this but somehow I became.

Anyways I came to this sub asking for help and will appreciate any help that anybody provide. And also can anybody please help me confirm me that the story titled ""My Girlfriend Disappeared right before my Proposal And 5 Years Later I Find Out She Ran of with my brother"" to see if it's real or not and if it was ever on Reddit? It will help me out a lot. Apparently it was on aita. Sorry to make this so long I've going though this for a while now and just want help.

537,1ddfvp1,I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm still clinically depressed or if this is just a matter of outlook,"I just saw a post about ‚Äúwhere do you see yourself in 20 years‚Äù and thought, well hopefully dead haha. I‚Äôm in my 30s and first experienced clinical depression in my early 20s.

‚ÄúIt gets better‚Äù HAS proven to be true, especially over the last 4 years. I have not felt suicidal in years. I am happy, made some big changes, and built a solid new support system from the ground up.

But if you ask me where I see myself in just TWO years I wouldn‚Äôt have an answer.

540,1ddr8o5,I Need a Direction,"Hello fellow internet users,

I need your help... Over the years I've been diagnosed with anxiety/depression by therapists and my PCD as well as ADHD by my PCD, I have received around three years of talk therapy/as well as a few EMDR sessions, 6 months of Lexapro, and a 10mg trial dose of Ritalin to see how it affects me in times of severe inability to focus.

I just find it strange none of my previous therapists suggested I had ADHD and it wasnt until I was on Lexapro for a few months that I was displaying severe signs of ADHD even though many of my Depression/Anxiety symptoms were going away.

I feel as though I still am not getting to the root of my mental health issues and have felt very frustrated at my inability to understand my issues, should I seek out a psychiatrist to get a full diagnosis from top to bottom? What can I do to fully understand my challenges?",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ddr8o5/i_need_a_direction/

Idk if it‚Äôs stress or something but strangely I‚Äôm calm right now despite being simultaneously panicking (liek an eye if a hurricane or whatever lol) it‚Äôs just my brain won‚Äôt stfu and let me focus.

542,1ddopim,Need advice on what to do,"Hi there! This post is a bit of a mess, as I can‚Äôt coherently explain my thoughts, but I will clarify anything if necessary.

All throughout my life, I‚Äôve been describing myself as being extremely lazy. I had trouble finding motivation to do monotonous tasks like homework or studying uninteresting subjects, especially after finding comfort in video games. However, if given task seemed interesting or challenging, I would find myself fully immersed in trying to master it. Thanks to it I actually managed to get good grades and be deemed as academically gifted. 

However, for the past few months my gf kept telling me, that I definitely have ADHD, and that I should seek professional diagnosis, to manage it, as it has been impacting me lately, causing me to lose all motivation, so much so, that even my hobbies stopped giving me joy. 

Now here‚Äôs where I have a bit of a problem. I don‚Äôt have enough money to go seek therapy on my own, so I‚Äôd need to ask my parents. Now, I haven‚Äôt told them about it, because firstly I don‚Äôt want them to see it as my excuse for my lazy behaviour and secondly I have hard time in general, confronting them about any difficult topic. For unexplained reason, it‚Äôs extremely difficult for me to ask them anything, as I don‚Äôt want to come off as ungrateful. On one hand, I do want to get diagnosed, or at least try. But on the other, the thought of trying to explain to my parents that I suspect I have ADHD, which I think they wouldn‚Äôt recognise as a problem but more of as an excuse, makes me very stressed.

Any tips on how I should approach this?

546,1ddqomh,I feel like I‚Äôm going insane,"Hello, I just need to vent about this because it‚Äôs genuinely driving me insane and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. 

So I, M19, am in university and I am in private halls. I have one friend who is also M19 and in my halls. Since I met him everything about me has crashed to the ground, along with the change from living at home to living at university.  He is important to me but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm important to him.  I have felt drawn to him since the start, but that has manifested in such ways that are unlike me. For instance, my brain memorised the sounds of everyone‚Äôs door so that I could recognise when he would come out his room, and then I would follow him out, which I didn‚Äôt want to do but it felt like I had to, like I couldn‚Äôt control it.  When he would socialise with others and not with me, I would lose it and cry and get so paranoid, then be so exhausted that I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed the next day. I have sought professional help, and it has helped, but the feelings haven‚Äôt gone away.  I‚Äôm able to control myself more and not follow him around, but I still get paranoid when he hangs out with others, although the paranoia is much more short lived now. It still distresses me though, and as I have been placed in halls next year it is making me fearful of socialising with the new people in case I start acting the same way, and I really don‚Äôt want to do that because it just pushes people away.   My emotions would cycle rather viciously each day at the start of the year, and whilst I have more of a handle on them now, I still have outbursts. I‚Äôm able to redirect most emotions, but I‚Äôm just so tired of doing this.

I have a psychiatrist that only writes me prescriptions and I can‚Äôt afford therapy.

Without getting too much into it (super long and ridiculous story), I was put through a long term psychological experiment without being aware and it gave me a lot of problems with persecutory [delusions (I hope)] and trusting people. I am VERY paranoid and I have odd patterns of behavior. I have only decided to try to address this years after the fact because I‚Äôm seeing someone and I realized just how odd my behavior is after I made her upset by randomly disappearing because I have this fixed obsessive belief that I need to throw an imaginary ‚Äúthem‚Äù off my trail.

554,1ddq0zf,Am I different?,"I'm a 20/F and I wrote this list of weird things about me at 1 am (Which may also indicate something). And I feel like it would be nice to get an outside perspective on this, because I think it might impact my social life and I need to see if anyone else feels like me. I didn't find any other subreddits where this would fit better on so I'm just posting it here.

 ‚Ä¢ I often zone out in group conversations or when people have a lot to say to me. Words go in one ear and straight out the other. And sometimes I can nod and say yes even if I don't hear what is being said. Because I say it on autopilot. I know this sounds kinda selfish but I really don't do it on purpose.

‚Ä¢ This zoning out also affects other areas, like when I'm watching a movie.

‚Ä¢ I currently have an imaginary boyfriend - as a 20-year-old... His nationality keeps changing now and then.

 ‚Ä¢ I sometimes have extreme obsessions with characters from movies.  When I was in middle school, I was very fascinated by the raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy.  I daydreamed that I was a talking raccoon in a universe inhabited by multiple species and in the same situation as him. Maybe I could relate a little to his mental problems. Or maybe I just wanted to relate so I could justify my struggles or something. 

 ‚Ä¢ I forget completely basic things such as locking the door before I leave the house or taking my car keys and phone with me. Although I try to remember it.

 ‚Ä¢ Sometimes I can sit in a chair or wander around the house for hours on end while daydreaming about various things.  I can have an imaginary debate, imagine myself as an actor in an imaginary movie, imagine myself in a possible or impossible future job or think about some imaginary boyfriend and what our relationship would have been like.

‚Ä¢ I think way too much about philosophical questions to the point where reality breaks. And I can't stop. All kinds of sensations lose its meaning because I know my brain is just making it up and if there were no humans, the universe wouldn't exist as we know it. And all kinds of concepts lose its meaning too because they're just built on other concepts which are again built on other concepts and everything is just energy but what's energy and it all started at the big bang but what created the big bang and so on.. I could go on forever about this. And I feel like it prevents me from enjoying the moment.

I don't think I have autism because I generally understand social contexts. Even tho I know  some of this can sound kind of autistic. I think I might have inattentive ADHD tho.

I don't do this anymore. And I don't enjoy it, but I also don't feel any guilt from it. I needed to feel strong. I needed something to understand the way I felt. An escape for my anger.

My parents, my older brother and my friends, basically most of the people around me wanted my help because of my emotional intellect. It's annoying. Listening to others struggles, I believed I didn't have the right to fell sad, I felt guilty and ashamed everytime I cried, because people had it worse. And I was raised in a ""don't cry or I'll give you a reason to cry"" household.I didn't want to grow this fast at all, just because I'm intelligent.

People have to understand that you can't just vent to anyone you see, just because they understand better. I'm pretty sure I shouldn't tell my age here, but I'm way younger than anyone here.

569,1ddngu1,Why is my dad a shifty asshole?,"Why is my dad such a shifty asshole

So for context, today I had a very important exam that I partially passed, I will most likely repeat the failed part after summer and when I phoned my parrents their reaction were these:


-Mom: understandable, supportive and somewhat pleased with my results and everything I told her what my professors told me after the exam

-Dad: ""YOU DIDN'T PASS!?"", agressive (even though he said he was calm and then told me why I was yelling even though I just slightly raised my voice to get to the) word, talked down on me (would later say ""he didn't mean it""), overall ignores the ENORMOUS amount of work he is well aware that I've put into prepearing for this exam, calls me crazy that I am going to therapy and that Im just wasting time


Now why do I think he is so shifty? Well its mainly because he's been telling me quite often for the past couple of months, that I shouldn't worry if I don't pass the first time and that I just need a bit more time to get it. That is before he doesn't get pleasing results and just does a 180¬∞ and says that the only reason why I passed my 1st year exams was because my mom ""helped me"" (she didn't, I did most of the learning, she'd just ask me questions before dinner) again compleatly disregaring another exam that I did after that one and passed it on the 1st try.

I really, REALLY, R E A L L Y don't want to hate my father like he hates his but ever since I started college I've either fantasized about hurting him the same way he hurts me or just doing something terrible to myself since it's been fucking misrable (hence why I go to therapy).

Should I just cut coms with him or keep them at a subzero minimum?",2,1,new,"I think maybe its time to cut the umbilical cord.  
I think a lot of people go through a kind of ""hyperreality"".  
Parents create a idealized simulated place where it's  
safe and we have a sense of unity.  
At least that's the idea we get as children.

  
Before I talk further. This is more important.   
TheShepherdsChapelChannelyoutube, with arnold and dennis murray.

But when we grow up we get some disillusionment because we question.  
Pressures of life or parents are just human and fail to maintain that simulation.  
And my thoughts as a child don't fit this new reality anymore.

If your parents in that home life was all you knew  
there's a dependency you can't let go of. If even subconsciously deep in your spirit.  
You know it takes a form of acceptance from your parents like you hinge on every word they say for approval.

Disillusionment comes into play when we just can't accept they're not who we thought they were.  
So we question..  
Without answers without our (simulated brackets) that define our perfect world, love approval whatever  
; we get emotional and lash out or entertain bad ideas like hurting self for others because they  
don't maintain or play along.  Even people we initially loved.

Otherwise if you didn't love your parents why would you care what they say?  
It Is time to mature and look at the world for how it really is.  
Your dad is not exactly going to be the person you want him to be.  
And I think its okay to say okay I don't have to be defined by him. That was for when I was a kid.  
Not now.

What has really helped me come to terms with this in my own life is just having a really deep sense of forgiveness. Realize that people make mistakes and got caught up in that Simulation themselves.  
You're experiencing their disillusionment that they couldn't let go. Just like you.

And we're not perfect we get old and get confused and that just happens  
life is full of meaning and confusion all at once. And its hard to navigate.  
I would love your parents just for the simple fact they brought you into the world.  
Even if your dad is a bit Shifty on how to express himself and your accomplishments;  
Love him anyway.

And you know keep distance like you said.  
Time to form a vision and plan in your life away.

Until you can love them without the pre defined parameters or (brackets).  
Then you can do the leading.

Just don't fall into the same pattern and repeat that simulation with kids of your own.  
Don't take your frustrations out on your family or a new one you bring into the world.

573,1ddmw7g,Tips for seeking FMLA leave for work-related anxiety and depression,"Hello!

I'm seeking advice from the community on taking FMLA.

I've been seeing some conflicting information online, and am trying to get a few facts straight.

1. **PCP Sign-off:** I've seen some say that PCPs can sign off on FMLA easily, while others say that they may be unwilling to until they've referred you to a psychiatrist for their opinion. Is this purely situational and dependent on your PCP?
2. **Psychiatrist Sign-off:** Some people are saying that they were able to make an appointment with a psychiatrist, who was able to sign-off on FMLA right away while you receive additional treatment. However, the first two clinics I have reached out to have said that their policy is 3 sessions or 3 months of sessions before they can sign-off on FMLA leave. Is this the norm? Or should I continue to seek out someone who can help me quicker?

I've been in weekly therapy to help manage my anxiety and depression for over 2 years through BetterHelp, and unfortunately, my therapist said it's against company policy for them to be able to sign-off on this for me directly. However, if I sign a release form, they said they would be happy to give their recommendation to my PCP or a psychiatrist. This is helpful, but I'm not sure if this would even go anywhere.

Under normal circumstances, I would be fine with a 3-month assessment from a psychologist. However, I genuinely feel like I've reached my limit with work, and it's spiking my anxiety. I'm days away from quitting if I can't get FMLA leave (which I understand may have other career-related consequences that I've given a lot of thought about and am willing to risk), so I really don't think I can wait this long. It's just not worth sleepless nights and chronic stress, and I want to move on.

I have a few appointments lined up, so ultimately, I will have more info soon. I just wanted to make sure I was going about this in the right way and have the right expectations for this.

Crying is a natural way to relieve emotional stress, but I understand that it can feel overwhelming, especially when it happens frequently.

It‚Äôs worth considering a few things:

How long have you been in therapy? Sometimes it can take a while for the benefits to really start manifesting, and it might also be worth discussing these intense crying episodes with your therapist if you haven‚Äôt already. They might be able to offer some additional strategies or adjustments in your treatment plan.

How are you coping outside of your therapy sessions? Do you have any strategies or activities that help you process your emotions or distract yourself? 

Sometimes engaging in creative outlets like writing, painting, or even physical activities like exercise can help manage feelings of sadness.

Being comforted by your friend seems to have a significant positive impact on you. Have you talked to your friend about how you feel? You might find some peace in knowing how they genuinely feel about supporting you.

It's also crucial to ensure you're not isolating too much. Besides your friend, are there other people in your life you could reach out to for connection and support? Even though it can be difficult, expanding your support network can make those moments feel less intense.

But I was the same, a few days of not going to the gym and I would start to feel like sh*t... Even having a rest day was awful but they're needed eventually. I know the gym is probably the key for me, feels like a mountain to climb but I need to at least try and start climbing it.

(score: 4) | If you are in need of an immediate distraction, play a game like finding all the purple items in the room, alphabet games, etc. sounds simple but it can bring you out of your head and redirect your mind.

Whatever is happening with us somehow somewhere our thoughts are reasons for it, and our thoughts are dependent on what information is available for them.

So if you surround yourself with negative pattern information or people or negative experiences from your life you will struggle with negative thoughts and ultimately you will end up being frustrated or facing depression symptoms. 

So you always need to try to be in a situation or be with someone or watch, read something which will change your information flow and will influence your thoughts.

The beauty of our thoughts is they are not constant and permanent they are continuously changing based on information flow.

If you are in pain or in the mode of loss of someone from your life and your feeding the sad songs information or being with something where you will have negative information flow you will struggle by being sad and unhappy.

But at the same time if you read or watch something where someone like you already passed through such a painful experience then you will have positive thoughts to survive and to go through it with less pain.

I hope you understand my point of view if not I am happy to explain more. (score: 3) | So if i am around ""toxic people"" that can make things worst correct? (score: 1) | They say negativity feeds on negativity, so no doubt toxicity feeds on toxicity.  
Aka Be around toxic people and your thoughts become toxic.

It kinda works in the same way as cults, hear something so many times and you start believing it too. (score: 2) | Thank you (score: 1) | Oh yeah. You have to guard your heart around people like that. What they have can consume you if you are not careful.  Trust is a gift that is earned. Don't trust everyone at their word. Trust them by their actions and their heart(their motivation). 

What's toxic to you may not be to me though. To be fair we all have our toxic traits. 
Find people who have gone through something similar and beaten it. Stick close to them. Ask them questions. Find people who will see through your bullshit. Who will love you but won't lie to you. (score: 2) | Yes for sure... (score: 1) | I am ready to share more expert view on this topic if you are interested..

Good news for you... You understood what's happening with you. That's a very important stage to start to change yourself. We have many people around they don't understand what's happening with them and they just struggle in the same situation as prison.

(score: 1) | I have a prepared script in my head for when I‚Äôm feeling bad. It‚Äôs affirmations and questions I can use to realign where I am and give me a chance to think differently about my situation. I‚Äôm generally working through anxiety but I‚Äôd bet it would help you as well. (score: 2) | I've found that the flow arts are a great release of aggression and good for your body and mind.

(score: 2) | honestly i hate that this work but light exercise. at least while doing it, you wont feel depressed, if you are able to muster the energy to do it. i had multiple disabilities so for a long while exercising was difficult and painful, but i found a few that i could do and it did changed my mood. (score: 2) | I have them often and what helps me is listening to music. Music calms my depressive episodes the most, albeit sometimes watching a show or a movie relaxes me enough. I just throw myself into something and distract myself from whatever‚Äôs depressing me. (score: 2) | So there‚Äôs something called shocking the system, there‚Äôs a few ways to do it, you can take a cold shower or let extremely cold water run on your hands, use an elastic band around your wrist to snap against it, hold ice cubs in your hands. What‚Äôs usually happening is your brain is disassociating so you need to basically remind it that your body is there. You can also take a walk or exercise too. (score: 2) | Let me know when you work it out. I had a complete mental break last time and it didn't stop till I noticed I accidentally stabbed myself in the process of slicing up my canvas paintings. 
Rip to the beautiful koi fish I painted. (score: 2) | Distraction helps to overcome the immediate intense emotions.
As someone who has fought this since I was 10 years old (now almost 40)
Be careful what you choose as a distraction 
As some distractions will pull down farther. Then you will spend years fighting addiction only to get back to solving the root.
Take it from someone who has mastered self destruction.

Writing helps me get it out of my head.
Breaking pretty things helps, too.
Do not break your shit or your parents' stuff.
Go out and buy some cheap china and smash it.
Or take a bat to old electronics.
I listen to music so loud I can't  hear my thoughts

Your depression is calling for you to show yourself grace, patience, and love.
Healing takes time and getting honest with yourself. 

Ask yourself, is this situational? 
Chemical?
Are you owning other people's feelings?
Are you not living the life you want?
What lies is your brain feeding you?



Take my perspective with a grain of salt. 

I am in the middle of being numb and embracing it. So this has always been my perspective when I am in these 2 stages. 
I also don't listen to my advice or wisdom most of the time.
So like I said.......Grain of salt.
Or
Take what you need and leave the rest.


My perspective is this  
There is power in not fearing it or fighting it.
My fear of depression caused more turmoil than the depression itself.
Fighting it only made it worse.
Why was I fighting it?
So I could be normal? 
Well, that ship sailed out a long time ago.

Fear of death?
Fighting it only made me wish I was dead more.
And 4 suicide attempts later, my question to myself is, what more can depression do to me?
It's taken jobs away, people away and left me addicted and I have survived it all.

The reason why I fight, however, is for control.
To control my emotions. I have avoided emotions all my life.
What part of myself am I hiding or avoiding?
Why am I in a civil war with myself?
Why do I have this need to fix myself?

The shitty tape recorder in my head is something I have never been able to overcome.
That breaks me every time. (score: 2) | Tbh lately i have been thinking ""is this the life i reallywant to live"" but the thing is i dont know what i ""want"" (score: 1) | ""What do I want"" is a question we all desire to know the answer. We are all faking it until we make it.

Sometimes figuring out what we don't want can help us check it off the list so we can find our life.
Sometimes that answer is buried deep within us under fear, rejection, life and reality.


Then other times we are looking so hard for our purpose when it's been staring us in the face the whole time.


Ask yourself questions.
There is something that always comes naturally to us.


A hard lesson I had to learn was that purpose doesn't have to be some big thing. (score: 2) | https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/

Be inspired by your spouse. Strange things happen when you tap into the mystical. I've seen people straight up become dreamy, time travelling consciousness... retrocausality in quantum mechanics.

Dream of wings; don't observe the big bang until proton-decay, everything. (score: 1) | Honestly i cant explain how much taking a breath, smoking and then journaling, doing art, yoga etc has helped my depression. I learned all these things after leaving the MH and i never want to go back so i make sure to apply them. I also try to make sure i take my meds cuz they help me process one thought at a time instead of freaking tf out. U got this. If nth else i mentioned works- take a drive or walk and go somewhere youve never been and find ur way back home while playing music. Does WONDERS. (score: 1) | I love music.

(score: 1) | I binge watch trash reality television or horror movies or media in general when I'm in a depressive episode. helps distract me. Also cleaning and organizing. The great thing about cleaning is that you will have instant satisfaction once you finish your project. And it's something you can look at after and feel good about. (score: 1) | 2 sharp inhales, one long exhale. It can reenergize and calm the nervous system. Anxiety (analysis paralysis) goes with depression so deep breathing exercises can help immediately calm the nervous system. Also journaling/scribbling have helped me get out of my head sometimes.

Start journalin, write down your feelings and things make it a space where you can express how you feel and get your energy out that way. It helps trust me. (score: 1) | You can‚Äôt. You need to take a medication. I have depressive episode too. (score: 1) | I don't know if I should say this but I find smoking Sativa marijuana helps with bipolar depression. But I live in Ohio where it's legal. (score: 1) | What helps ground myself is to list what symptoms I'm feeling during a depressive episode. Then I can at least start to not spiral and *maybe* do something about those symptoms if I have the energy to.

For example my symptoms today:  
feeling hopeless, loss of appetite, slow speech/brain

Listing those at least helps me put some distance that I am not depression. Hopelessness, poor appetite, & slowness does not define me. I *have* depression. These are just symptoms and symptoms can be treated.

So I've never actually been assessed or officially diagnosed with anything, but I've suffered from anxiety since my early teens (I'm 28 now). 

I had a baby 16 months ago and more recently my partner thinks I've developed depression, I'm not convinced I have it though. He thinks my occasional low mood, irritability aimed towards him, low self confidence and no desire to have hobbies are signs of depression. I've had multiple different types of therapy in the past for my anxiety and self esteem and nothing has really worked for me. I don't really have hobbies or interests and haven't done in years, all I really do in the evenings is scroll the internet, but this all feels normal for me. I also suffer from periods of unexplained insomnia at times but not sure if that's relevant as it isn't negative thoughts keeping me awake.

I'm leaning more towards thinking these emotional issues are hormonal, but previous tests done by my doctor showed no hormonal imbalances.

There‚Äôs so many things in dealing with right now like struggling with school, career anxiety,  being trapped in a really bad job, being back home with my parents one of whom despises me bc I can never seem to live up to their expectations, a guy I really liked and connected with very well completely blindsided me causing me to lose trust and feel deeply insecure , I‚Äôve lost so much weight that I look like a skeleton and have lost touch with things that were once huge passions of mine, and I owe so much debt. I try my best to have an optimistic outlook on life but today is just one of those days I want to give up. I know everyone says it gets better with time but it‚Äôs to the point where I don‚Äôt care to look forward to the ‚Äúgood days‚Äù because my reality is so bleak and seems hopeless almost. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression and emotional disregulation for years but I‚Äôve always been able to keep it under the wraps or appear as ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù but that mask is beginning to fall . The way my parents were raised lead them to not believe in the importance of good mental health as there was little to no emphasis of that in their households growing up. Even with them both being successful medical professionals it just doesn‚Äôt exist to them and i emphasize with them being that they were raised on tough love so it‚Äôs all they know. God, my nieces, my mom, and sisters have been the main motivators for me not taking my life yet and keep me going. But I‚Äôm starting to feel like even those VERY important things won‚Äôt be enough to keep me here. Often times I fantasize about a car hitting me or some freak accident happening so they know it wasn‚Äôt on my own accord or so I won‚Äôt go to hell. I know the potential I hold but it‚Äôs always been so hard for me to just DO. Taking initiative is the first step to real change but how can I tackle that if I have task paralysis when it comes to even the smallest of things. I don‚Äôt mean to boast but I know the intelligence I hold it‚Äôs almost as if I can never apply it and it‚Äôs the most trapping feeling ever. I feel as if I‚Äôm at my wits end and I get nothing but bad luck despite trying to show everyone love or help out every single chance I get. I feel cursed almost and it makes me question whether or not I even belong on this earth anymore. The world is already so corrupt and evil so I feel like I won‚Äôt miss out on as much. Eternal rest seems so enticing but I know that if I seek it those ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions will never get answered. I don‚Äôt know what to do I‚Äôm so lost right now.",1,1,new,"**Hello u/!**

I'm 27 and still single. I've been single for the past 10 years. I have tried so many times to find someone, but it always ended before it became a relationship. I have asked them if I did something wrong, and I always get the same answer: I did not do anything wrong, but they just didn't want a boyfriend at the moment, even when they dragged me along and played into it.

2 years ago now, I got really close to a girl who had a child, I got really fucking attached to this child, and he got attached to me... She promised me day in and day out that we would be together... One day, she texted me and said she needed to stop talking with me... That was the lowest I had ever been, and I just wanted it all to end. I was there for her and her child; I even came running at night when she had panic attacks, even when I had work the next day. I pushed everything in my own life away to be there for her. I miss her and the child.

Since then, people think I am doing better, but I am hiding how I really feel. I started working out 4 times a week at the start of the year, which helps a bit, but the loneliness still haunts me... Every single night, I want to drink or wish I had meds to get high and away from everything.

  
I don't know what to do anymore. I keep telling myself it gets better, but it hasn't gotten any better for years now. The only time I was truly happy again was 2 years ago because even how stupid it sounds, that child made me feel like there was a reason to stay alive because I felt loved by him, always smiling when he saw me and got all happy... Damn, I'm tearing up again now.

I've been thinking about ending it all, but I keep on going every single day, even when I want to give up on everything. I just feel like I'm getting closer and closer to the day when I end it.

592,1ddki8m,I need to be better,"Suggestions, strategies needed.

I‚Äôve come a long way in my mental health, anxiety and depression. I‚Äôm a mom and a wife and live in a country that is not my own. I have no strong family ties but I have made a few friends here. 

My husband got very frustrated with me recently, saying I need to take more control of my mental health. I am currently not taking medication or in therapy. I am uncomfortable with medication and all the local therapists have massive wait lists.

I take care of our kids and do all the household jobs. He is frustrated that I lm too tired to work on the farm with him, to work on the paperwork side of the business (he won‚Äôt do paperwork) and that I don‚Äôt have any hobbies. He says I‚Äôm just a sad lump on a log and he isn‚Äôt looking forward to being together for the rest of our lives if I can‚Äôt be a better, more productive person. 

I do cope with things by shopping. I‚Äôm insecure about my body after having kids and hitting my late 40‚Äôs. I buy lots and lots of clothes we can‚Äôt necessarily afford because I just want to not look awful in something. I‚Äôve started working out and I‚Äôve lost some weight finally, but he‚Äôs upset I‚Äôm doing that instead of getting outside and working on the land. 

I know I need to work outside more, I know I need to stop shopping, I‚Äôd love to make art again like I used too before the kids and the business. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I have to start waking up at 5 with my husband from now on. I also need to be calmer and stop taking my bad moods out by yelling at my kids or saying hurtful things to my husband. I‚Äôve stopped  myself from having panic attacks most of the time, even when my depression is hitting hard I still make sure the kids are well cared for. I have a lot of good coping skills too, but I‚Äôm not sure how to hit the next level of getting better. ",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ddki8m/i_need_to_be_better/
593,1ddkgz1,Struggling with Chronic Pain and Mental Health at 30,"Hello, I‚Äôm 30, male. I don‚Äôt know where to start or why I‚Äôm writing here, but whatever. I‚Äôm having increasing trouble getting through life. I broke up after being in a relationship for 5 years, and 4 of those were rather unhappy. I‚Äôve been feeling progressively worse, both physically and mentally. Because I swallowed my anger and dissatisfaction all those years, I felt empty and lost. I thought the breakup would be the best thing and that I‚Äôd feel better because of it. 

Now, four years ago, I got sick. At first, I didn‚Äôt know what it was, just had pain all over my body. Some days, it was almost impossible to dress myself. I could barely move my neck for almost a year, which was unimaginable to me since I was always sporty and agile and never had such problems. After countless doctor visits and tests, it turned out to be ankylosing spondylitis (Spondylitis ankylosans is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease. It primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints but sometimes also other body structures), and also hip dysplasia wich courses pain in the hip area. I got medication but The pain was bearable, sometimes better, sometimes worse, but there was always a slight stiffness in my body.
I also suffer from tinnitus, which I‚Äôve had for almost 15 years, and it significantly worsened last year. It‚Äôs like a 24/7 distraction in my head, and I got used to it but now that it got much worse making things increasingly difficult. My mind doesn‚Äôt come to rest.

I feel increasingly lost and, in my early 30s, physically and mentally at my wit‚Äôs end.

In the past, I would have told myself, ""Okay, take fewer drugs and take care of yourself, then you‚Äôll feel better again,"" which I did. I joined the military, was sober, exercised a lot, and was disciplined. All of that has largely been lost in everyday life. I mean, I eat healthy and stay active by doing sports. I still occasionally take drugs, but only on the weekend with friends, within limits. 

But I‚Äôm getting older, and the physical issues are getting worse. It feels like my body is giving up at just 30 years old, leading to mental problems, and I can‚Äôt just tell my body to stop being sick. I feel worthless and ugly because the signs of aging are visible on me.

- 
-
having anxiety at mechanic class (the teacher manages to make it a living hell despite me sitting in the front, writing everything on my notebook and studying, but since I am recovering from burnout, it's now harder, and that makes me procrastinate sometimes due to not being able to focus and study at home)
- 
-
trying to uncounsciously avoid the next day by sleeping late
- 
-
beginning to stay at university to avoid home (I think the reasons behind that is that my family knows I am having a hard time at university (this course of mechanics is making me and my classmates to study exclusively for the course tests, and I believe that more than 75% of the class won't pass this semester in mechanics alone) and completly ignores it or (in case of my sibling) tickles me when I am trying to rest or procrastinate (wich pisses me off, because I am believing it's because they think it's laziness, and not me having a hard time) and asks me why I won't play with them or even asks if I am really going to study (wich drains my mood even more), and for the rest of the family members who lives with me, asks me to help with mudane things when I am studying and my sibling is free to help them, and even becoming mad when I refuse (wich obliterates my study routine) 
- 
-
my family disliking my hairstyle and clothing preferences (I lived my entire life untill 17 yo using the hairstyle and clothing they wanted, but nowadays I am exploring what I enjoy. But I can't still negate that this is impact my life, since it's relatively common with subtle things (like saying my fringe is covering my eyes and will hurt my vision or laughing at me for using a clothing or hairstyle that is different than what I used to have, or even asking why I don't show my forehead (the reason being that I disliking the style, but they won't listen) and saying I shave everyday (wich is far from true, but they won't listen that I dislike having a beard or body hair other than my head hair and that very likely it won't change) 
- 
-
my grandparent who lives in my house dislikes criticisms or being pointed out as being wrong, and is a controlling person since the time of raising my parent
- 
-
I am starting to believe that they are indirectally blaming me for not going to pass the course and loose my scholarship (I can't deny I could do better at the beginning, but feeling that they are ignorating my attemps to improve and my huge growth that I had and not even supporting me emotionally is infurating)
- 
-
I want to help them financially and to make them have a better life on another country after graduating. But their behaviour and the fact my graduation will be slower is also impacting me (my uncle and aunt said they can help me if I don't pass, but I am worried about their finances even thought my aunt has a profession that pays good in my country, and honestly, I know somewhat what to do if I don't pass, but I am afraid of getting stuck again in the same situation when retaking the course or studying in another university
- what should I do to atleast have a slightly better time (even if it's on the next time)?

Am i crazy?,"As a kid, I was abused by my mom, mostly emotionally but with a few moments of physical (I think, I wasn't ever truly beaten but food was withheld commonly and I was underweight when I was kicked out of her house when I was around 11, to which i went to move in with my dad.) I had it decently with my dad but he pushed me to be extremely independent, and thus (and this is what my stepmom has told me) not really have a proper childhood. When I was 15 i cut contact with my mom, to which she freaked out (She has borderline personality disorder that's mostly untreated if that helps in describing her actions and mannerisms), and there was a huge fight but I ultimately won. Shes done some other stuff over the years, such as sending me an email while I was at work (age 18) on why it was my fault that she tried to commit suicide, and I also found out later that my dad was not even my biological dad, and the list honestly goes on. Also after the years that I moved out she refused to let me talk to my sisters, claiming I was a ""threat"" to her family and that everything that happened was my fault. 

My dad put me in therapy at a young age, because he didn't know exactly what happened with my mom and I didnt realize that what happened at the time wasnt normal behavior. I got iq tests, diagnosis and inititally I was diagnosed with abandonment issues before eventually being diagnosed with trauma induced depression. 

  
My therapist always praised me for how well I managed it, and at the time I agreed, but now that i'm older (22F) I don't feel like ive managed it well at all. My memory is awful, and i can't remember anything until I do if that makes sense. Ill have moments of clarity and then ill spiral. Im also married now, with a 1.5 year old, and my husband always argues that if i can't rationalize why i feel a certain way, then i shouldn't feel that way at all. I wish he would just let me be upset sometimes but he always gets annoyed if I am. It doesnt help we have been rocky due to some internal issues of not feeling loved, but part of me feels like i want too much. Lately I just feel like a child, I want to cry all the time, and I just feel so isolated and lonely. I find myself with a strange urge to go home, but I'm not really sure what that even means. I guess my question is, is this feeling ever going away? I don't like medicine because I can never really remember to take it consistently, but im really consider going back on it (I got off when i lost insurance at 19). I want to be a good mom too , so i'm desperate to get better. 

Is it wrong to still blame my mom for these feelings? Could I have more than just depression?

598,1ddjm9o,Constant Unbearable Pain ,"Hello everyone, I just don't know what to do, I just can't get over pain of losing the future I fought and planned so hard for. Throughout college, I was dating this girl and we had a very serious relationship. She met my family (which all lives outside the country) so that was a monumental deal for me. We were each others best friends, etc, etc, typical love story. One day after graduation, we found out she was pregnant. It was a rush of emotions because I've always dreamed of being a father and this was my time to be everything I wanted to be. A husband, a father, a leader, a provider. It was the same month that I graduated that we found out so naturally my emotions were all over the place-happy, scared, nervous, anxious especially since I was just about to start my career as an engineer. It was sooner that I expected but I was ready to step up. Long story short, we lost the baby and it was absolutely devastating for us. Even though the baby was not born yet, the pain is unimaginable and I don't wish this on anyone. I would do anything to hold my baby girl right now. I ache for her every single day, its something you don't just heal from. I feel so connected to my baby girl but she's not here and it kills me everyday. Long story short, a few months later, we had a rough spot, I'm honestly not sure why, it just happened. Maybe the stress from me entering grad school and her entering more rigorous nurse classes? I'm still not sure. She ended up cheating on me and got pregnant by someone else. Now this is already absolutely soul-crushing as it is being cheated on, but knowing that our baby didn't make it and theirs did hurts beyond a level words cannot create. The guy is a terrible dude, he's already a deadbeat to one kid, has another kid on the way from his fiancee, and now has another one from the girl who I was suppose to marry. This hurts my soul so much because everything I fought for so badly got ripped away so fast. Its all I think about everyday, what my life was suppose to be and now its so lonely, so empty, so meaningless. I was suppose to be a father. I was suppose to be a husband. She was suppose to be a stay at home mom. But now, its just empty. The void of what was suppose to happen is ruining my everyday life-more so the fact I should be playing with my daughter. To make matters worse, I've only been in about 3 relationships in my life. This was my first ""real"" relationship but the other 2 ended almost exactly the same way. I've been cheated on in every relationship and it plays a huge toll on me mentally. Am I worth finding love? All 3 girls I was with cheated on me and then had a kid with the guy they cheated on me with. The other 2 were extremely short relationships (max 3 months) but it still hurts and I can't talk to anyone about it because its so embarrassing and I know people will make fun of me and I'm already on the edge as is.

600,1ddja4h,please please help,"

Brother‚Äôs (21M) behaviour is concerning. He wakes up angry very often. Small things anger him, which seem to anger him to no limits. He will fixate over small problems that occur in daily life (such as shirt being wet) and hold on to this/ be angry about it for hours. He is in a terrible mood every single day, probably since years now if I‚Äôm being real. He doesn‚Äôt enjoy interacting with anyone from the family. He is rude to people who try to talk to him. He does not want help from others when he is angry or irritated. He isolates himself, acts depressed, and then goes to sleep for hours. When asked about anything, his standard answer is ‚Äònothing‚Äô. He takes no responsibility around the house nor does he listen to others when they ask him for his help regarding anything. He is extremely narcissistic and self centred with little empathy. He has some good moments during the day, which are extremely rare. What I‚Äôve observed is that he has a lot of constant highs and lows. More lows than highs though. He doesn‚Äôt know how to manage his emotions and constantly argues with anyone when they try to talk it out with him. He is disrespectful and raises his voice, leading to no productive or constructive conversation/criticism most of the time. Needless to say, he does not communicate with anyone. This is probably out of choice since we have prompted him to seek help from us multiple times. He does not realise how his erratic behaviour affects others. But if it doesn‚Äôt change it‚Äôs likely to break the family apart. When we speak to him about it, sometimes he completely victimises himself and spirals while blaming himself, leading to another depressive episode. He also punches the walls and throws things around when he is pissed off. Small things trigger him which cause hours long of bad mood, anger, depression and the cycle repeats. It seems like he has deep resentment towards everyone, for no apparent reason. Our existence simply is a disservice to him and we are all an inconvenience to him. That is what his behaviour communicates to me.

Any advice is welcome. If you have faced a similar situation, please let me know how you overcame it. He probably requires professional help but what kind? Kindly recommend. Does he have some sort of disorder?

Getting to your questions, not all his life, but probably since the last few years I‚Äôd say which is progressing each day.

How would such deficiencies cause this behaviour? (score: 1) | I mentioned thyroid and iron specifically because although having those alone wouldn‚Äôt explain all his symptoms, they could explain a few. 

When my iron and ferritin were low, I was tired and irritable. I already do have depression and it made it worse. Same with the thyroid. I have hypothyroidism and it can really affect how you feel by adding to depression. Vitamin D and B12 can affect depression, too.

There is something called ultra rapid cycling in Bipolar:

‚ÄúUltra-rapid cycling symptoms

Ultra-rapid cycling doesn‚Äôt indicate mood symptom severity, only frequency and duration. The DSM-5-TR states that features of mood episodes in rapid cycling are identical to those seen in a nonrapid cycling pattern.

This means the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder ‚Äî depressive episodes and mania or hypomania ‚Äî are present in RCBD, just occurring more frequently than what‚Äôs typical.

‚ÄúPeople move from experiencing signs of depression to experiencing symptoms of mania or hypomania in the space of just a few days, a day, or a few hours,‚Äù explained Dr. Chanel Johnson, a licensed professional counselor and CEO of Altus Home Counseling in Detroit, Michigan.‚Äù

602,1ddj1kx,"I imagine things, what's wrong with me?","[SLIGHT MENTIONS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE]

So the question is ""what's wrong with me?"".
I would like to know if the problems I will list are symptoms of something.

To clarify, I'm a minor (soon adult) that has never been to therapy. I've never in my entire life seen a specialist or been to a hospital. My parents think it's a waste of time.


The problems are affecting me greatly.

Throughout my entire life I've been imagining people watching me. I do not mean real life people, but imaginary people that usually appear next to my windows, inside my house. They make me feel judged, I always tried to restraint from doing anything they would deem weird.
Usually, they take form of my favourite characters (I find comfort in cartoons and shows) so it feels worse when it's ""someone"" I look up to.
My family was already calling me a weirdo and thinking I'm useless. So I was wondering if this affected me so much, it spread to fictional characters? I can't stand being next to windows. I know they're not real, I want to believe that they're not real.
Over the years I started to get used to it, so I'm less affected by it. I think it was at my worst at ages around 5-7 and 12-14.

Another problem with imagining things; the screams I hear.
Often when I leave my house, I can hear screams coming out of it. This only happens when I know my father is awake, because if anyone screamed in pain it would be because of him.
I have a little sister, and every time this happens I just freeze in fear and I'm petrified. What if something really happened? Me and my brother are the only ones who got abused to this extent as little kids, she's not been in that situation yet, but I can't keep thinking of something happening.
I usually calm down, but then I'm late for school or work, and it's been affecting my education greatly.

Another case of imagining things, I feel presence or I see dark figures at night. I am convinced I will get hurt or killed or worse, though most of the figures look too inhuman so I sometimes have doubts if they're real.
Right now when I'm writing this, I know they're not real. But literally every other time I am actually scared and I feel as if it's real.

I was thinking if me imagining things was some kind of a mental illness? I am not able to be diagnosed, and I don't talk to people (I often limit myself to hand gestures) so it's hard for me to get any kind of help.
My grandmother has a really bad schizophrenia, she isn't even able to have normal conversations.

Or all of this might be because of the abuse I've gone through, I'm assuming.


I might make another post describing my other problems, and I would love to find out if everything is somehow connected. I am not a fan of self diagnosis, but this is the only way I can take a first step to help myself.

603,1ddik3i,I need recommendations on coping with emotional dysregulation stemming from ADHD. ,"I've(23f) had ADHD for years, but was actually diagnosed in the last year. it's caused me anxiety, depression, causes me to have issues making friends, makes it hard for me to trust, issues with cleaning but most recently, emotional dysregulation and anger issues. 

I've always kinda had anger issues, throwing things, yelling, cutting people out of my life, etc. but between that and my emotional dysregulation, I feel like I'm going to lose my 4 year long relationship. we will get into an argument, and seemingly it doesn't matter what it's about, I just shut down. I get choked up, I cry, I do my best not to yell, and I feel physically incapable of talking. this is where my bf(32m) doesn't quite get it. he also has ADHD but has had an extra 9 years to navigate the world and find coping mechanisms. I really love him, and he says that he still really loves me, but we're walking on a very fine line together and I feel like any second could be the last together. 

so PLEASE, how do you navigate emotional dysregulation/anger issues/trust issues/etc, with ADHD? I would love to go to therapy but I can't afford it. I want to make things work with him, I want to make things work with myself, as I've been very unhappy with myself for a long while now. any coping mechanisms, free therapy, ways you and your ADHD partner navigate stuff like this, anything?

On march 20th I lost very dear cat of mine, his name was Brownie, Brownie was supposed to turn 1 year on April 23rd with his brother Darkie and his 2 other litter sisters Haze and Maze (kittens from different mother). 

I was having hard time because he was a cat I really chose for myself(btw all of my cats were born into our family and not adopted) because I felt deep connection with him like I did w my other 2 cats(that passed away 3 years ago) and I felt finally ready, we were having amazing time but one evening he was run over because he left our yard (we live in rural area so most of us have out-door pets)

On April 15th my grandma passed away, late night, my mom was talking to her 40 mins before she passed away. She died of heart attack in my grandpa's arms. It was really sudden because she was known as healthy one, she never went to doctor because she always found herself a home remedy for any type of sickness (that would actually work) however, she died due to having water in her lungs. A month before she said her back was hurting but she was getting better, 2 days before she passed away she even sang with my grandpa, as she always said ""Sing so loud to forget any type of pain"". Unfortunately one evil doesn't come alone. So when we went to the house late at night trying to get her changed, call funeral services etc. My aunt said that we should prepare chairs for the coffin so my grandpa said he'd be getting it since it's downstairs. But my mom told him she will get it because because my grandpa is diabetic and his pressure was super high. When she was going downstairs lights went off and she fell down. Breaking her heel bone. It's been 7-8 weeks and she still can't move properly. She used to be super active in house but now all she does is lay, watch tv. She has became super pesimistic and depressive, she mentions death every single minute and she lost will to live. She is smoker so the amount of cigarettes she is smoking is scaring me.

He hit his head against the car and when he fell down on ground, his face went in half, literally. He was still alive, and he was rushed to hospital, he was supposed to receive surgery but because of the already damage, the doctors couldn't do anything and he passed away in hospital when his mom found his body cold. He was born in October of 2007, so he was 16. What pains me alot is that I felt huge connection, and he was first guy to ever compliment me, we talked alot on SNS so I thought maybe I had chance. But I decided to lose weight and try to get a glow up before confessing. I was planning to confess to him on June 23rd when school is ending so it doesn't feel awkward going to school and seeing him if he rejects me, but this is what I feel most guilty about and regret. I would rather like getting rejected if I knew something like this would happen. What pains is seeing some of my classmates who were much closer to him crying making me re-think am I allowed to even cry when I probably wasn't as close as them to him.

This is just weird my social anxiety doesn't let me go out without perfect dress makeup perfect accent perfect grades . My first consider is what would people think is it appropriate to post in one dress twice a day i can't stop it , i need serious advice it's killing me giving me breakdowns often",41,23,new,"Others don't think about you as much as you think they do (score: 26) | Doesn‚Äôt this have a name? Something syndrome? (score: 2) | We all think about how people think of us. But we assume they think of us the way we think of ourselves. So just work on accepting and giving yourself daily affirmations.

You don't know how people think of you, you just assume it's the same image you have in your head.<33 (score: 13) | As someone who also struggles with social anxiety on a daily basis, realize that people can have their own opinions on the things you do, but they have no power to do anything about it. For example you can just be doing random stuff and someone will feel the need to tell you that you‚Äôre being ‚Äúcringe‚Äù but they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt remove every ‚Äúcringe‚Äù cell in your body to prevent you from being weird again. If someone can‚Äôt change something about you (nobody can change anything about you) then their opinion is automatically invalid and you should just be unapologetically authentic and move on with your day. Something I‚Äôve learned is that the more authentic you are the more you attract meaningful people in your life and weed out people who aren‚Äôt good for you. I know it can be hard sometimes but just fake it for now by telling yourself positive words of affirmation whenever the thoughts of low self esteem occur and be consistent with it. Eventually you‚Äôll notice that those positive thoughts become a habit and you won‚Äôt be faking it anymore. Just be kind and patient with yourself and know that things take time. (score: 6) | Have to work on your insecurities first.  Start finding ways to love yourself.  Once that happens, you'll careless (score: 3) | In simple terms, start caring about yourself and what you think. When we have to deal with people who are dysfunctional it can sometimes lead to us being worried about making others upset or being rejected. At some point in your life someone taught you that love only comes from other‚Äôs approval. And they likely had high or impossible standards. 

Now your fear has outsourced your entire being to other people and instead of seeing and feeling what you have inside, your fear has led you to seek approval from the outside to mask your fears. I do this too, but in a different way. I want others to be the adult, make my choices for me, because I can‚Äôt allow myself to feel things. Mostly pain. 

Recognize that you have an internal world full of difficult emotions. That those emotions were put into you by someone who didn‚Äôt understand what they did to you. And that to heal you need to face the things you fear most. Because the blockage is causing you to ignore yourself and be genuine to your own needs. 

We need our emotions to help us decide what is good or bad. And if you ignore them, they only become more intense. And start overwriting our true selves. Sit down with yourself and ask questions like, ‚Äúwhat am I feeling?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere does it come from?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is it trying to tell me?‚Äù

Try to feel the good as well as the bad and let your emotions be your guide. If something feels bad, slow down or hit pause. Look at it, talk about it, ask questions. Try to be less impulsive. Sometimes we fall into automatic behaviors without even thinking about it or noticing. Try to notice before you fall into old habits. 

Over time and with a little help, you may learn to see yourself, but it will be a difficult road. Healing can be a long process. Be patient. Be caring and give yourself some attention that maybe you didn‚Äôt get in the past. (score: 3) | i used to think about what others think 24/7 for years it soon got so tiring i had breakdowns cause i couldn‚Äôt even go for walks without thinking someone who knows me will judge me. for me, i got so sick of feeling like that i just did whatever i wanted.  everyone else is busy with thier own lives and is to busy thinking about them selfs to be thinking about what u post and do. and if they judge or leave hate comments they definitely have something wrong with them and should get help lol. 
also you see people on a daily basis and probably don‚Äôt even remember them. (score: 3) | I had similar issues and my psychologist helped me a lot with systematic desensitization. I started posting easier photos like landscapes, then I posting drawings that I made and thought were really good, then she suggested  that I post the process of the drawings or drawings that I thought were average. Then I started posting drawings of characters, which I thought were more cringe and difficult to me, then I started posting videos, personal photos and so I started feeling more confident and comfortable. 

I must say that it is impossible to stop thinking about what other people will think, especially because the intention of posting things on the internet is to know what other people think about it. But the secret of systematic desensitization is that little by little, without creating situations of anxiety, we start to realize that our fears make no sense, that people are better than we, the anxious ones, imagine and that we are more capable to be loved than we think.

It is important to be aware of your thoughts. What thoughts do you have when you think about posting a photo of yourself? How could you contradict these thoughts?

What helped me the most, to be honest, was realizing that no one really cares about what I'm doing, that if I post something in less than a minute they'll forget about it. But most of all, that I have the right to post if I want to, regardless of what other people will think. I have the right to make mistakes, to be ugly, to try again, even the right to be rude to a certain way. It's incredibly difficult to change our mindset, but that was my personal process.

I particularly identify with you when you say that it kills you, but it is possible to change. Sorry for the long text. I have a lot to say about it (score: 2) | This was incredibly helpful to read for me and others in this thread.

(score: 2) | It's easier said then done. There are lots of ways to get there but you must find what works for you best for instance. Someone I know who is really religious uses the mentality that the only person who can judge you and whos opinion matters the most is God for him. I'm catholic but not really religious, so for me it's more around the lines of no body knows what I'm going thru cause no one has walked a mile in my shoes so their opinions don't really have value to me. But I advise looking at yourself not from others view but your own find somethings that you love about yourself or that you can atleast appreciate about yourself and go from there. And try to remember opinions are like paper money. It only has value if everyone involved gives it value. And don't forget your a legend never think less (score: 2) | there's a mistake in the title. (try to not care about it and you'll find the answer to your question) (score: 1) | ask chat gpt if it's mature then post so you won't regret it in the future (score: 1) | See yourself in your purest form. No make up, regular clothes. This is you and you are beautiful. Imagine if your regular self is how you‚Äôre supposed to look (which is true) and learn to love it. Also I suggest stop posting in general. It causes too much expectations from yourself, wanting people to react/not react and certain way. It‚Äôs all truly unnecessary (not to be a bummer). Imagine feeling no need to post anything. I understand your feeling and the posting habit /getting fixed up habit very well as it once destroyed me too. I learned that I was tired to tweezing my brows all of the time, waking up an hour and a half early for work to do my make up, to wearing uncomfortable clothes all day only because they were ‚Äúcute‚Äù. I had bigger things to worry about, I was overloading myself for no reason! Focus on things you really enjoy that do not involve self image. Get into skateboarding, painting, reading, writing‚Ä¶ whatever! Perhaps scratch the posting itch with talking about it with people of the same interest here on Reddit (or platform of choice). 

Stand back and realized that not doing those things IS okay. It‚Äôs ok to not be top-notch! When I finally let myself be free I went to work without make up for like a month. I felt good‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt feel pretty but good‚Ä¶ and once I tried make up again- I felt fake and found beauty in my true self. I prefer my regular God given face. Now I just fill in my brows just a tiiiiny bit and do a little mascara for work. Does the trick! (score: 1) | Just accept it, because no matter who you are or what you do, someone somewhere is going to have something to say about it.

This meme sums it up perfectly.

It‚Äôs been that way since i turned 30. It takes a long time to learn about yourself and be comfortable in your own skin in any situation.

This is a tough one. You need to understand social behavior but also not fall prey to poor social behavior. Your constraints or standards are your own. 

I do it by being ""good"" üëç, if I'm not harming anyone, harming dictated by how a person presents ""acceptable behavior"", then I'm okay.(the definition allows for things like relationships but also justice).

Learning what people expect from others is cool, you can utilize it to gauge your opinions and theirs, scrutinize both to see what is more logical, important, or situatiinal. Creating these triggers may help you accept some things and disregard others.

Like everyone poops, talking about it in a poor situation can be funny or bad, doing it in front of people can show comfort or shamelessness. Talking about it logically/seriously shouldn't be cringe or disgusting, but insightful, whether like this or to a doctor. (score: 1) | Think about this. How much do you think about other people?

then start actually deciding what is practical you can study for and obtain in the next year or two. And build from there.  
Dont be fearful. Love alot. And forgive alot. yourself and everyone around you.

Health. Monitory this well. Because today there are so many pollutions, like hydrated oils, and fats sugars and salts, and artificial flavors, that harm your health over time, that you'll waste so many years right there trying to stay alive.  
Be active and moving. And informed about what you put into your stomach. Trust me, dont eat fast food.

Hygiene keep clean. Brush your Teeth!  
use dental floss and wash your hands.  
Getting sick is no fun and will waste years.

Paper plates paper bowls and spoons. If you cant manage a small set of dishes. Dont bother. Just get disposable stuff and keep your kitchen clean so you dont waste time washing everything. Unless you have someone who can do that for you.

If I wanted to go deeper,  Manage your money to the last cent. Theres a lot of unforeseen traps in the world.

People said I should get a new provider, so I have an appointment with one tomorrow. I am using some of my rent money to pay for it. This is after having two panic attacks, the second one way scary, on top of struggling to care for myself. 

I am so anxious now I throw up anything I try to eat. I can't shower because of my anxiety (and I need to clean out my shower) and overall am struggling to function. 

I'm stressing about it a little because I don't know what I am going to do about rent, but my OCD support group told me I was making the right decision. I'm also stressing because I know when I ask my mom to pick up my meds and bring them to me shes going to complain bc she's already been out here this week to bring me groceries (I can't drive, nor do I have a car). A friend also helped me out by ordering me bath wipes, shampoo caps and a few other items so I could at least get clean without having to get in the shower. I also ordered kid scissors  (too scared to order grown up scissors) to cut my own hair. Its so dirty and matted, I look like a filthy troll doll. Or like filthy Vegeta. I've cut my own hair before but I am worried about how short I want to cut it. Never done a pixie cut on myself but I figure its hair, it will grow back. But the items won't be here until Thursday.

The point is that my mom will have to come out here 3 times (because all my amazon packages go to her address, bc we can't receive mail where I live) OR I will have to wait until at least Friday for meds and items. I'm not sure which option, because I don't feel like I can wait until Friday but I don't want to inconvenience my mom. 

I want to try the Geodon (the med my old psych yelled at me to forget) again because when it was working I cleaned my entire place, was holding down a steady job, wasn't having anxiety as much, wasn't depressed and was a functioning person. Then it suddenly stopped working and I ended up in a behavioral health hospital after a manic episode that kerplunked me into a HORRID depressive episode. There they switched me off Geodon bc they didn't wanna deal with the fact you have to eat 200 calories each time you take it (I took it 3 times a day, which was admittedly hard bc I have an ED and only eat once a day normally but I worked hard to keep up with it). BUT NO OTHER MEDICATION HAS WORKED THAT WELL. I would cut off my limbs just to feel that good mentally again.

I also want back on propanolol for my heart rate. 

I'm hoping this psych will listen to what I have to say and we can work together to make a treatment plan for me. Thanks for letting me ramble a bit.",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dde55v/struggling_to_keep_food_down_seeing_psych_tomorrow/

Giving up something is a simple process because you just don't do it, it's not like taking up a hobby or learning something. So then it's all about how much you really want to stop doing it.

I reflected on moments I'd missed out, like staying in instead of going out with mates because I chose to get high instead, or not wanting to go out on day trips with my girlfriend because I knew after x hours I'd want a joint.

Then when I actually stopped, the hardest bit was defeating the muscle memory / routine of having a joint.

On and off at the start because funds are limited as a teenager with no job or a part time job.

I have ""self medicated"" myself for a long time from a young age (14) and I have been smoking cannabis ever since.
Once I got older the consumption also increased because I started working and could afford more (okay maybe not as much as I thought at the start) .

During all those years I have acknowledged , that for myself, the consumption has had a genuine positive addition to my life as well as it being a downfall in other parts.
This took me about 15-18 years...

Once I started smoking I was able to let go of issues cramming up inside of me which made me a whole lot easier to socially engage with. That was a big plus. since one part of starting to smoke was the constant feeling of being alone and ignored next to a few other ""inconveniences"".
I was an angry and I guess traumatized kid in dire need of some help and all I could do was lash out.

The downside was that I never resolved many issues untill a much older age because all I was doing was surpressing them,. Easy way out huh? 

When I got older I had moments where I smoked a lot in bad times and less in better times, depending on my situation in life I guess..

I have had issues in school, work, social circles etc without the smoking, but on another level there were also problems when I was smoking.

I am very tolerant as I can do a lot of things while being high like work, focus, play sports, write this (haha) and thus it doesn't impede me (much) except for the fact that when i ""smoke too much"" that i just don't ""feel like doing anything at all"" .

The part where the cannabis helps me mellow out and chill out is nice and it was a good ""lid on my internal can of anger"" but when you stop caring about bad stuff... You risk also caring about other stuff and not wanting / can / be interested to put effort in stuff that you would do when you're sober.

In the meanwhile I think I have gotten far in addressing my problems and i can live moments without smoking, especially when its not available like when you're on vacation somewhere.(Which also removes the ""stresses at home&work"" for me and thus more chill in general)

Problem is that I'm still dependant because I'm not sure I will be able to keep that can of anger closed by myself.

It's a finnicky thing.
Know what you're doing or try to find out would be my advice.

I won't say you need to quit or keep on going.
I'm not going to tell you how to live your life.
I do hope you get to a point where you can make a solid decision for yourself on what it's doing to you and whether that is something you want (Or maybe regret).

Peace out and a big hug brother.



Fun fact ; 

I became a social worker at the age of 21. 
Who would have thought, huh? (score: 9) | It's objectively terrible for you to do it every day . I used to think it helped me mental health wise and made me creative etc etc but really it held me back so much . 

Made me an irritable and slow zombie who didn't give a fuck about anything or anyone. Ruined my sleep for years , just put my mental development on hold completely. 

Best thing I've ever done is quit weed even though I'm only 5 weeks into it so far . Memory is back, stable mood, more money and not coughing. (score: 9) | I‚Äôm 23 and been smoking since I was 15. Daily, all day, everyday. There was a point during and after Covid where no joke I was smoking 5 blunts a day. This drove me bat shit crazy because without it I was a complete mess. Through time I eased off it more and more, I recently just got out of a 6 month t break. Now I only smoke 1 bowl before bed. Looking back, this has held me back tremendously. From making social anxiety worse, to making depression worse, made me very self reliant because I enjoyed it so much I‚Äôd skip plans to chill and get high. At 23 I sadly can say I wasted my teens being a burn out. My advice, smoke but do it at a moderate pace. Smoking at night is your safest bet being you won‚Äôt be high during the day, this allows you to be more productive. (score: 5) | And yes, Memory loss and anxiety have only gotten worse. Like really bad so keep that in mind. Everyone wants to talk about weed being good for anxiety and it can be, but overusing it will flip that switch and make it so severe. I didn‚Äôt fly on planes for 3 years due to this. Never had a panic attack in my life until I started burning heavily. (score: 3) | I became really lazy. I had a job, went to the gym, and still maintained a social life. However, what I mean by lazy is that I became somewhat dejected from social interactions. I was too lazy to meet new people. I was too lazy to keep my home maintained. I was too lazy to maintain new relationships. Overall, I just went through my days high all the time and had to smoke more and more as time passed. I wasn't progressing at my job because being high made me find happiness in complacency. I wasn't progressing at the gym because, well, munchies. I wasn't engaging at parties or bars when I was with friends. My sex life was just okay. Became the hook-up guy for a while, and never persued a long relationship. For all the pros that I got from Cannabis, it took me going cold turkey to recognize the cons. I went from smoking all day every day to a couple of times a month after a long break (6 months). The break made me learn to appreciate Cannabis for what it is. There's absolutely nothing wrong with taking breaks. I'm in my early 30s now and living the single dad life. I partake whenever I feel like it, which isn't all the time. In my late teens, early 20s, it was my entire persona. Now, it's just a small part of my life that I spark up when the time is right. (score: 5) | Keep in mind this was during covid lockdowns and combined with a burgeoning alcohol abuse disorder.

It's just kind of like, I'm aware I'm dependent on weed to get by but I'm not strong enough to really quit on my own yet and being high is just the default so I don't necessarily deal with the memory loss or loss of function anymore but it doesn't help me like it used to. It's just like a think I'm not strong enough not to do (score: 3) | Yes all of those things are from the weed, for me it was really hard to quit doing it everyday, but now I do it like every 10 days and it‚Äôs like a cloud has been taken off of my vision, I can think so much more clearly without it. (score: 3) | I went from going to the gym 5x a week and being one of the top students in university to flunking almost everything and having to retake half of the subjects i had gained 15kg of weight in 6 months.Any mental health i had went down the drain I was in my darkest moments.
Been clean for 6 months now and plan to remain so that shit is horrible and there are a lot of people just looking past the risks.
I finally stopped when i gave someone a joint who had a very bad reaction to it and then i realised i was throwing my life away and stopped. (score: 3) | I did it for many years. Started due to mental illness.

It helped me for a while until it hurt me. It started to hurt me when I became fully dependent on it. I was what you would consider a ""'functional"" stoner.

Work- I was mostly in school during that time period, and I still got good grades but I could have done SO much more in terms of extracurriculars, networking etc.

Relationship- Not sure how much better or worse it would have been with or without weed. I am just as lonely as ever right now.

How did I come out of it? Therapy. Reminding myself constantly why I needed to stop. Probably the biggest was marijuana anonymous meetings (you can go to AA meetings if you don't have MA near you, or you can do MA online or by phone). Check out the marijuana anonymous website for details, it shows all the meetings. 

I don't think you are becoming lazy. I think a drug is having side effects you are experiencing. Sometimes it's easy to forget marijuana is a drug, and it should be respected. Just like Prozac, Opiates, or even Tylenol- they all have to be respected for the impacts they can have. They are foreign substances entering your body. Of course they are all extremely different, but they are medicines/drugs nonetheless. Our bodies are intricate, and introducing new things will have impacts whether they are large or small. I'd like to validate your memory loss and loss of concentration as side effects of daily marijuana usage.

I am really sorry you lost your girlfriend! I wish you all the best. Remember, this is just part of your journey. Bumps in the road happen, it wouldn't be life if it was just all smooth. (score: 3) | I‚Äôm a mother in law. My daughter had my precious granddaughter almost 4 years ago. Her partner is addicted. We all moved into a house together because they couldn‚Äôt afford to live alone. This man is so lazy, neglecting his daughter constantly. He‚Äôs never done anything to hurt her, but he just ignores her, stays in his room with lights off most of the day while my daughter works. Luckily I‚Äôm a teacher so have lots of time off, but I  am disabled  so its hard to do a lot, but I take her out and try to keep her busy. I get so mad at him that he can‚Äôt take her to the park or do anything with her. I can‚Äôt imagine what the days are like when I‚Äôm not here. He works 3-4 hours a day, but that money is minimum wage and for the weed. Doesn‚Äôt contribute to bills, If you think you‚Äôre cool being that way, please don‚Äôt have kids. My daughter and I have to do everything plus support this guy. I don‚Äôt dare say anything to my daughter which causes her to defend him. But I hope she gets sick of it soon. (score: 3) | I smoked daily for about five years, then quit. While I smoked I was a ""functioning pothead"", getting by okay but not having much luck maintaining relationships and just getting by. After quitting, I got married, started a family and launched a very successful business. I am also happier. I definitely regret wasting those years. I wonder also if I did some permanent damage to my brain. (score: 2) | Honestly I feel like whenever I take it back up, always due to peers, I become lazy and lost in life again. I manage to stay focused living alone, just not having it, and lose myself when I smoke, then it turns to habit. (score: 2) | I‚Äôve smoked for years, I think 6 years now. At first, maybe the first year or so, definitely made me lethargic and lazy. Since then, however, I‚Äôve been able to function while smoking. I work, play basketball, still have a social life.

Only advice I would give is to not use weed as a coping mechanism. I made that mistake and I believe that‚Äôs the reason I am so addicted to it now. Weed, like everything else, is useful in moderation. (Everyone is different though) (score: 2) | I smoke a lot, but I‚Äôve been smoking less lately, however I‚Äôve smoked daily for the past 4 years. Definitely notice brain fog and just generally feeling stupid. Slow thinking especially when high and just overall forgetting a lot of stuff. When I don‚Äôt smoke it‚Äôs less difficult so I try to keep it as a at home activity since smoking at work fucks me over usually. (score: 2) | I smoked near enough every day for like 5ish years. I thought it helped me a lot but it made my life so much worse in retrospect, it impacted my ability to accomplish everything. Moving through reality like I was wading through treacle. When I couldn‚Äôt get hold of it on a day for whatever reason, it felt like the sky was falling. I was so dependent on it, and pretty much made it my personality. 
I self medicated, but I‚Äôve learned that everything I‚Äôve been running from finds a way to hit me with full force if I‚Äôm not high. Pain demands to be felt, I guess. 

I stopped for a while because I lived in a place where it was extremely difficult to get, but I started again when I moved in with family who were heavy smokers. Since moving out again, I‚Äôm in a position where I don‚Äôt know anyone to get it from, and I like it that way. I don‚Äôt really crave it now, last time I had anything was last year. I gave up smoking nicotine as well, around the same time. I can‚Äôt do moderation with stuff like that, a cheeky joint will turn into a 3 month bender if I‚Äôm not careful, so avoidance is key. 

I feel a lot better. Granted, I‚Äôm now properly medicated for most of the things I was self medicating for, but overall this works better for me. (score: 2) | I was unproductive, permanently faded, slept a lot, lazy af, had a shit memory, didn‚Äôt seek out schooling or a job. Basically I had given up on myself.

I eventually got a job because I got into a relationship and wanted to be a better partner. Later I moved away from the environment that pulled me down. (score: 2) | I smoke about 1.5 or 2 grams a day. I find as I get older. The weed is more anxiety inducing.

I‚Äôd love to quit, but it‚Äôs a lot harder than it seems. (score: 2) | I went about 3-4 months smoking straight and I was miserable af. I stopped for 2 months and felt amazing to the point where I was afraid to even start smoking again. I started again but funny enough I did fine. I realised that weed accentuated whatever feelings I had and wasn't the root cause for my depressive episode. I'm not saying this is the same for everyone, it hits us differently on a physiological level, but you might just be smoking daily to cope with something. Why do you feel so comfortable smoking when you know it's ruining your life? (score: 2) | I smoked daily for 3 years, it made me so horribly sick, I had horrible relationships, have forgotten 99% of the time, I now get lung infections extremely easily (just note this could be unrelated but I don't know why else it started), I was depressed and anxious all the time (or just sleeping), I started dating somebody who encouraged me to do better on my health and I am now over 5 months sober. My mental health has improved, my physical health has improved, my entire life is overall just better. (score: 2) | Smoked weed for 4 years I was not able to function well at all aside from all the obvious side effects like brain fog, poor memory, not being able to eat/sleep without it, etc. i finally decided to quit because of its effect on my motivation and sense of urgency I realized that I didn‚Äôt really desire to do anything that didn‚Äôt involve getting high and that‚Äôs when I knew it was time to stop

It also made me socially reclusive there was no point in me going out to parties or social events when I could just get high at home and game. It definitely exasperated any social anxiety I had now that I‚Äôve quit I feel like a different person in regards to social skills (score: 2) | Lowered fertility and struggled to conceive. 

Stopped smoking, cut down on alcohol considerably, became healthier = baby batter quality increased 

Now I have a goblin running throughout my home, who owns my wife‚Äôs boobs. (score: 2) | I smoked multiple times daily with my friends and siblings. In the moment, it was fun and we had lots of fun. I‚Äôve always had a strong memory, but weed really affected my short term memory. Weed used to calm my anxiety, but once my friends all moved and I smoked by myself, it just made anxiety worse. One thing I never experienced was laziness, but my friends and I were always active so I‚Äôm not sure if weed could‚Äôve ever stopped that.

After revisiting weed, it has only ever given me paranoia. Makes me kinda sad because I can‚Äôt experience weed like I used to. But maybe I‚Äôm just sad thinking about the memories I had with weed.

On a side note, my friends and I smoked heavily, but we never did stupid shit like some people do. We never did back to back dabs, intentionally greened out, took stupid amount of edibles, or smoked just to forget. People I‚Äôve seen do that, seem to have a variety of issues. (score: 2) | Memory loss and no ambition. I used to be extremely passionate and knew what I wanted from life. I graduated high school and went to college and did pretty good for my first year. Came back home for the summer and had more access to weed than I ever have before or since and started smoking my back out. Also went through a very tragic loss and kinda had to be the strongest in the house so this only amplified the use of it. Got back to college and didn't have any motivation at all and started flunking due to not going to class. Literally only thing I wanted to do was smoke weed. Half of every paycheck I got went towards weed. Ended up with a really really bad weed addiction. Depressed when I didn't have any and wanted the day to end as soon as possible. Didn't even enjoy food anymore without weed. It took me 2 1/2 years to fully kick that shit and I honestly can say that it's for nothing but the best. I got my memory back, my ambition back, my appetite back, and pulled my grades up to the point where failing a class wasn't even in question. I'm now about to enter my final year of college after not graduating when I was supposed to this year due to me focusing on weed instead of my studies. Still smoke from time to time but nowhere near as much and I'm honestly proud of myself. (score: 2) | was lazy asf didn‚Äôt wanna do shit but smoke and eat living in my mom house has no ambition.

As everyone else says, memory loss, mild paranoia, anxiety, laziness, indecisiveness, etc.

The worst though is that I was a complete addict, so I would spend a lot of money it, maybe ¬£150 per week, and smoking this much also makes your lungs feel bad especially when you have smoked on and off your whole life.

For me, life is much better without it in every way, but I know a lot of people who function absolutely fine on it and smoke every day without issues. I also know people who are in mental institutions from daily use. As with most substances it depends on the person mostly. (score: 2) | Stop smoking it now my dude, I know guys that really into it and now they are super slow, I dunno If they did other drugs to be fair.

Also people watch it with the hard drugs, it can make your brain snap and make you skizophrenic, youll be hallucinating and hearing voices telling you to punch people for life and the worst part is that youll never be sure if theyre real or not even with the meds. (score: 2) | I have social anxiety and smoking weed turned out to be the worst thing someone like me could possibly do. It made me more anxious and isolated. (score: 2) | Smoking for 8 years on a daily basis, took a break for 6 months and it‚Äôs good for introspection, not something to be used on a regular basis but once on you depend on it, then your brain convinces you to use to feel better. Smoke once a year or two years, one joint or probably a few drags, that‚Äôs all you need. Not smoking joints back to back everyday (score: 2) | Not sure why everyone else here is supporting smoking weed, but i relate to what you said. I smoked continuously for 2 years, lost my girl of 6 years due to the same. Loss of memory, loss of concentration to an extent where it felt like i was lost in life man. And this is coming from a guy who was always at the top of table at everything i did. Functioning stoners may exist, but if you keep messing with the chemicals in your brain it affects you bad bro. Your dopamine levels rise up to an extent which is unmatchable with anything else you do in normal life and your serotonin which makes you more focused, emotionally stable, happier and calmer goes down low. Low levels of serotonin are associated with depression. (score: 2) | It‚Äôs bad for you. Not because it‚Äôs bad for your body but because it‚Äôs bad for your life. Stop it. Sooner than later.

Or are there perhaps other things going on? I deal with depression/anxiety/PTSD on the regular, but weed always alleviates all of this for me. However it took time for me to get to that point. It used to just freak me out and send me into a psychosis. (score: 1) | I‚Äôve been smoking since I was 14/15 and I‚Äôm 28 now. I function pretty well! But I smoke at night usually, not consistently through the day. 

However, you are acknowledging a problem with it and should back off it. Once you start to be affected like this with anything, tap out for a bit. 
You probably are using it to cope with other issues that a therapist should be helping you through, not weed.
It‚Äôs not worth it. (score: 1) | Ingesting weed is a really strange thing, it affects people in many, many different ways. I personally used to smoke for years, as in the better part of a decade. I would usually only smoke and the late evening and averaged probably around half a gram a day. I didn't realize at first, because the negative effects showed only slowly overtime, however now that I am in my mid-20s, I'm realizing it's done me more harm than good. 

It's affected my memory significantly, it gave me anxiety during the day even when I wasn't smoking it. It suppressed by appetite during the day when I wasn't smoking it during the day, which is not good for me considering I'm already a pretty skinny dude. I quit cold turkey as of, probably around 7 days ago. Been dealing with some insomnia ever since then, some digestive issues, some recurring anxiety. However, now those symptoms are diminishing, and I'm starting to feel better in general. I can pay attention much better, my memory is improving slowly, and my anxiety isn't quite as bad. It's been I rough week, but I think I made the right decision by quitting, and  I'm hoping that things will only get better going forward. However, that's just my personal experience. It obviously doesn't affect everyone so negatively as it did me.

It didn't affect my work life, it didn't significantly affect my relationships. It may have made me slightly numb, and less interested in people in general. But other than that, I was able to get everything done that I needed to get done in day to day life.
 Still don't regret quitting though. (score: 1) | Smoked on and off for twenty + years. Much of that time daily. 
I can‚Äôt say it took my motivation because when I started I was a teenager with adhd. if anything it helped me resolve some of the mental blocks I had around that. 

I‚Äôve completed two degrees and held down jobs etc without issue. But I have also learned that whatever comfort or pleasure weed is giving me can be found elsewhere without the cost. 
I‚Äôm now only using it on the odd occasion I need help falling asleep. But even that isn‚Äôt so helpful. 

Ultimately the negative impacts you are reporting, is weed helping you deal with them or is it a form of escape? And if it‚Äôs a form of escape, You could ask yourself why you‚Äôre not wanting to resolve these issues head on. IMHO weed doesn‚Äôt help with d thinking through complex things and instead reinforces old patterns and ways of thinking.

My wife, if she smokes gets stoned as in spacey and tired, if she takes edibles she more talkative and not as stoned but still spacey high. She is not a productive high, so she smokes when she doesn't have anything to do, otherwise nothing will get done. 

I've more self medicated with it for over 2 decades now, it helps me focus on individual tasks rather than everything at once and helps with my creative/critical thinking. I can function while high, but I don't smoke all day, just in between things and stay a little high most of the time. 

My brother flat out can't smoke. It causes him mental issues and psychotic episodes. While he can enjoy the occasional gummy. 

If you enjoy it, use it responsibly and that means whatever it means to you. But figure out how it affects you and use it around that. If it makes you lazy don't smoke when you have things to do. Some people I know just can't enjoy it because it makes them too paranoid. (score: 1) | I have a younger brother who started smoking as young as 13 until his early 20s.

however, i‚Äôm able to be more mindful of my feelings, i can think before i react, has kept me from needing my prescribed benzos from panic attacks, pushed me to go out on hikes more, has let me eat, etc

it‚Äôs all about moderation for me, i can tell when my use turns into abuse and that‚Äôs exactly when i take a week or two away from it to reevaluate my relationship with weed. then i determine if im able to moderate it or if i should give it a few more weeks

overall, it has impacted my life for the better. i love how im able to use it as a medicine. it also helps me steer clear away from harder drugs (score: 1) | For me man it‚Äôs been extremely helpful.

I take meds as well and the pot mostly helps me get out of my shell and I‚Äôm less afraid to live if that makes sense. 

It‚Äôs not easy tho man, keeping your life together and balancing your mental health but pot helps me get up and keep going.

Especially if youre a youth and your brain still developing. 

And to be honest some people benefit from it. At some point it stopped benefiting me. It helped me during my low points in life to process and reflect deeply and rebuild my world view but overtime it just started to make me dependent on it due to my depression. Inuse it every now and again to allow myself to reset for mundane schedule and or force myself to sleep when i feel too distracted and restless.

Psychologically, I have suffered a lot of child hood trauma, as well as a lot of trauma due to work in older life. 
So I can‚Äôt be sure, I have been diagnosed with BPD, Bipolar, CPTSD, Epilepsy and the list goes on, my psych knows I smoke and has never been for or against it, however trying to get on to medicinal cannabis has been a problem because of my past psychosis and Bipolar. 

I had a suicide attempt about 5 years ago, where i was hospitalised and pretty much forced to quit. 
I fucking felt so good, I loved it, but I found I just didn‚Äôt have the same joy doing the same things I loved like gaming. 

So I started smoking again, my partner also passed away which was a big factor, but I was recently diagnosed with agoraphobia and AdHd am at the time I was a year off 40. I‚Äôm 40 now, I fucking hate my life, I want to go out and play in my gardens (but can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm fucking scared of everything) my best friend fucking hates me, I still smoke and I don‚Äôt enjoy gaming anymore. 
So yeah, that‚Äôs how it affected my life. I call every Tuesday ‚Äútoaster Tuesday‚Äù because it‚Äôs the day I fight with myself every week to not throw my toaster in the bath while listening to the Anchor ‚öìÔ∏è. Sounds specific but I have my reasons, always gotta have an ‚Äúescape plan‚Äù.

I think if it has these effects on you, you should slow down how much you‚Äôre smoking, or stop entirely. If you‚Äôre also depressed, that causes laziness for me, not the weed. If my life situation was better and I could afford basic things right now, I‚Äôd be much more inclined to clean the litter box, pick up after myself, etc. but it‚Äôs not so bad that my room is a disaster, and my bf will call me out if it gets too bad.

I smoked all throughout college (non academic work, studio & computer work) and I had the best grades in my whole academic career! Which, the bar wasn't very high.


Now I'll admit, I am definitely addicted. I've never taken a voluntary tolerance break, only when traveling where I can't access it. This affects my ability to eat when traveling, which is great because I don't gain weight on vacations! But it sucks as I miss out on trying a lot.¬†


The past year or so I've been thinking about quitting, as I'm spending too much on weed, and I'm noticing that it's starting to negatively affect me. Plus ive heard that adhd medication can counteract with weed.¬† (score: 1) | Smoked non stop, on a daily basis for 6-7 years and now I rarely do. It's just a really bad habit because of laziness, lethargy, lack of focus, etc. 

For a very longtime I would convince myself that it helped me for X reasons and that I was a ""functional"" pothead but that's just BS. 95% of weed smokers WON'T admit weed is overall negative for a number of reasons. And yes, there might be a few positive effects from smoking but none of them are exclusive to weed EG: like feeling relaxed or being able to sleep better, which are benefits you can also enjoy from doing excercize regularly without the negative effects from weed. 

  
Overall quality of life for any individual is better without weed. I still like weed but I can understand and admit now that I'm better without it. (score: 1) | I‚Äôve smoked almost everyday for like 3 years now. Normally I‚Äôm a bit unhinged, manic, don‚Äôt sleep don‚Äôt eat, working 15 hour days, but since I started smoking I‚Äôve become a lot healthier. I ONLY smoke after 6pm as a way to relax my brain, and I find that even when I‚Äôm sober, that relaxation carries itself with me throughout the day. Sometimes I miss the power I had when I was manic, I wrote a book, could work multiple shifts in a day, etc, but that kind of lifestyle honestly isn‚Äôt healthy and would‚Äôve drained me eventually.

Weed helps me negate all aspects of my life . Especially others bullshit (score: 1) | Definitely not being lazy and I can relate a lot. What it mostly did for me is put me into a sort of a psychosis. I was extremely depressed for a few months (due to my bipolar) and weed made me hallucinate and get delusional. I realized it was the weed because it all stopped when I stopped smoking. I still struggle with use but I been clean for a week maybe? Mainly because my anxiety has been over the roof and I just know it would make it worse (score: 1) | It‚Äôs working for me I don‚Äôt need medication for my depressie just only weed. (score: 1) | You cant blame your problems on weed. YOU lack discipline and self control the weed just amplifies that. I was smoking 2/5 grams a day for a year straight at 17-18 years old. Didn‚Äôt buy new clothes, didn‚Äôt save up for a car or anything ALL my money was going to the dealer. One day i felt like a zombie and stopped cold turkey. VERY easy so do if you‚Äôre serious about changing your life. (score: 1) | I had a medical card for quite some time. It turns out it made my anxiety worse and I would keep spending all my money at gleaf to find the right fix because apparently it should fix my anxiety from what I heard. A few ER trips for panic attacks and I gave it up. My mind and bank account thanked me. I'm now on Zoloft. I really wanted to avoid pharmaceuticals after a fear of bad reactions, but I'm all good now. ü§ôü§ô
I actually had withdrawals which were terrible. I'd get moody and sweaty and just felt gross. It wasn't fun. For people who smoke for fun, awesome, but for me it made my issues worse and the come down was uncomfortable. I didn't like the chills and sweats. I couldn't sleep worth a lick either. 
All hail Zoloft üëç (score: 1) | I'd been dosing during the day. It helped with my mental issues and actually motivated me because it made daily tasks seem less difficult, less of a chore and less daunting, so I was able to do more. I don't work with others so I wouldn't recommend this in a conventional workplace. (score: 1) | I'm having a hard time quitting. I quit drinking, so now time to move on to weed.

(score: 1) | Smoked everyday for last 25 years and am doing great, helps me manage my autism and adhd (score: 1) | I smoked for 4 years daily. I loved it, until I didn‚Äôt. I realised I pushed all of my emotions out, it made me lazy, unmotivated and mostly fine with how I was. Working shitty jobs and being fine with it. 

After a while I just realised it was time to stop, I couldn‚Äôt go on like this. I stopped for 6months, it was good, then I went back to smoking daily again.  I loved it too much. Again I realised I cannot keep doing it, I am just pushing away my true emotions and myself for a half baked high that passes and it‚Äôs not even enjoyable anymore. 
I decided I will only ever smoke again on special occasions and only a few hits if someone has it with them. 

Since then it‚Äôs been almost half a year again and I am much more in tune with my emotions, world is definitely more tough but I am learning new ways to cope with it and heal parts of myself that I was trying ti self-medicate with weed. 
Overall I miss it a lot. Getting baked and not having  thousands of thoughts coming up at the same time but having one thought at a time (mostly a dumb one).
But I am so much happier without it.
The clarity, the not feeling lazy and tired all the time, not being a zombie to my friends and family really improved my relationships and made me realise what‚Äôs actually important in life. I got back to the hobbies and things I love doing. 

Oh and also what helped me a lot, the day when I decided to stop. I wrote down in my journal: Day 1 of not smoking, and kept writing day 2, day 3‚Ä¶ until I didn‚Äôt have to write anymore. Didn‚Äôt actively think about not smoking. Just didn‚Äôt smoke anymore. 

Conclusion: It made me put my emotions under the rug for a very long time and made me ‚Äúfine‚Äù with the life situations that weren‚Äôt that fine. Stopping smoking has improved my life. (score: 1) | Life constantly feels like a dream and I craved it more and more, I went from just smoking before bed to smoking whenever I had some free time. Made me a more angry person too, I‚Äôd fight with my family whenever I wasn‚Äôt stoned because I was so easily annoyed. I‚Äôm currently trying to get off it. (score: 1) | Smoking (almost) daily for about 4 years and it has done wonders for my physical and mental health.

I think it's the things you do alongside smoking that makes the difference.

As a daily smoker, the things you do whilst high will become a habit and those habits will become your reality.
You need to be mindful of everything you consume, think or do when high as a daily smoker.

If you smoke once in a while, indulging in munchies, mindlessly scrolling social media, playing video games or thinking about the past/daydreaming can be a fun activity.

If you smoke daily and do those things, they will lead you to some dark places.

1. Rather find a physical or creative activity to do whilst you smoke. Write in a journal, draw, do cardio, lift weights, do yoga, dance, cleaning, sewing, painting, sculpting. Find something you can do daily that you enjoy.

2. Be very mindful of the music you listen to, weed puts you in a very susceptible state and the music listened to will affect your mood. Create a playlist of upbeat music. Explore different genres of faster paced music.

If you struggle with social media when you're high, put your phone on airplane mode and put a timer or give yourself a set amount of time before allowing yourself to go back online.

3. To avoid unhealthy snacks, make a healthier choice the easier choice, before you smoke, chop up a bowl of fruit and have a large bottle of water close at hand. 

Making a habit of these three things takes time and patience(it took me years), but if you do it whilst high, it'll gradually improve your experience of weed. (score: 1) | I‚Äôve been smoking for almost 5 years now. i was diagnosed with CPTSD and bipolar 2 at 15 ‚Ä¶ i started smoking at age 19, while still on my medication. at 21, i have stopped my medication (with approval from my psych) but still smoke on the daily. 

i have seen a greater improvement in my life and how i manage my mental illness and the behavioural shit that comes with it. smoking has greatly impacted my life, like my relationship is healthy, my friendships are good, and my academia is prospering. but i also know it‚Äôs not the same for everyone. 

smoking, for me, doesn‚Äôt really make anything more difficult to do. ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù and procrastination is something i have struggled with for so long and at this point it‚Äôs about challenging my norms and comfortabilities for something that could actually improve my life. so at this point it‚Äôs a lot of mental gymnastics and effort that has pushed me forward. 

i like the act of smoking, i enjoy buying, smelling, rolling, and tasting the different strains and i use it recreationally but i am also extremely aware of how harmful it can be if used for the wrong reasons. 
using it as a coping mechanism or to be cool will not be helpful in the longrun. 

however, despite it being a good option in my life, it has contributed to some short term memory loss and slower thinking and application but i think that‚Äôs something that comes with a weed high but my abilities aren‚Äôt as impacted when i‚Äôm sober. so i try to avoid smoking when i know i‚Äôll need a clear head or when smoking would actually prove unhelpful in a situation. 

be well-educated on your vices and increase your self-awareness. you‚Äôll know what‚Äôs your limits and what‚Äôs good for you. (score: 1) | Stop smoking weed, that stuffs not good for you (score: 1) | I‚Äôm going to be honest with you it really depends on a lot of factors it varied greatly for me based on where I was at in life. As you grow older you become more of who you are, you change. Over the course of 16 years the phases I smoked it was for different reasons when I was in different parts of life, one to laugh and joke with friends as a kid, next to deal with extreme loneliness and stress and others just to get rid of some boredom. My reaction to it also varied greatly based on where I was at and how old and mature i was. How many jobs I worked or where I lived. There were times I couldn‚Äôt ever imagine smoking weed again but then years later had no idea where I would be heading and how I came to rely on it again. There is no way for any of us to tell you. Get quiet, meditate, journal or take a calm walk and you‚Äôll get to that point of knowing what benefits you have to reap or if it isn‚Äôt something you want to engage in right now. (score: 1) | I was constantly overanalyzing everything about who I am and what I‚Äôm doing. If you have a solid foundation then weed will probably be great long term, if however your mental health is struggling, it‚Äôs going to cover it up until your body is completely disconnected from the mind for not taking care of it. I learned just yesterday that this was the case for me & im so heartbroken to have to stop for now. I couldn‚Äôt function anymore, I couldn‚Äôt focus ever, I was questioning reality, drove in circles last week because I kept missing my turns because my mind could not stop going back to overthinking. I even took a month off work because I couldn‚Äôt do my job & I thought it was just depression. I was sober yesterday and I wanted to cry because I was me again, I wish I didn‚Äôt have this reaction (score: 1) | Depends on the person. I have autism, no appetite due to my liver (genetic problem), chronic pain and OCD so it just chills me out, lowers my pain and helps me with social interactions. I have a smoke schedule, I wake and bake for my mood and appetite, I usually don't smoke throughput the day unless I visit a stoner friend, and then before bed for my aches. 

For ME it's a godsend, but for someone else it's a burden and an addiction. I've gone through periods where I smoke more than that, there's no reason to unless it's a special occasion imo. (score: 1) | I ALSO TAKE st. John's Wort for depression, I didn't list it because I'm asymptomatic atm.

As I said in the title of this thread : I don't feel good. In fact, I never felt good. 

For several years, I don't know exactly how many, I would say in my twenties (I'm currently 28), I feel a general malaise, a loss of identity, sudden and excessive mood changes. 

For example, I can be euphoric one moment, want to party, drink excessively, and the next moment I can sink into depression. 

I can mutilate myself when things are bad to get better. Usually by hitting me, sometimes by cutting and biting my flesh. 



I suffer a lot from the eyes of others and I attach great importance to what they think but I always think of myself as judged, betrayed and abandoned sooner or later.

I hate myself to the highest degree. I'm worth nothing, absolutely nothing. I'm in a relationship with someone fabulous and I feel that I always make life difficult for him with my moods.I can interpret the the smallest thing like a mountain.

But I've been in severe discomfort for the last 12 years of my life. I've been in pain for a full 1 of the last 6 years, and I am too exhausted to keep pushing past it hoping things will improve. 

My dentist has pushed and squeezed about all they can into my treatment plan, but this new thing, this abscess. It's somewhere they don't expect it. And they can't do anything about it because it's not in my plan. And while that seems to be a first world problem or something that's easily fixed, I'm tired of this being my story. I'm tired of the ceaseless pain, the impossible struggle and discomfort of eating, and the relentless blow to my confidence and ability to communicate and socialise. 

So I'm finishing my course of antibiotics, and optionally my pain medication, which has done nothing but make me sick. But I'm then losing 2 of my top front teeth, one being a primary front tooth. I've already lost 5 molars since I grew them. What's another 2 teeth. Eating, once something that brought me joy in life, has no appeal. There's just no point to anything any more.

It took me a few seconds to answer because I really wasn‚Äôt sure. I finally said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really feel anything.‚Äù He asked if that was towards my wife and I said towards everything. I don‚Äôt care about any relationship I have. I don‚Äôt care if I see anyone, speak to anyone, etc. 

I feel so much anger over the smallest things sometimes. To the point where I bite my teeth to hold it in and it feels like they‚Äôre going to break. I‚Äôve lost all interest in old hobbies and don‚Äôt care to pick any up. 

My therapist asked if I‚Äôve ever been through anything traumatic in my life and I told him about my careers. His eyes got wide and said, ‚ÄúThat makes sense‚Äù. He said I‚Äôm showing signs of PTSD (not diagnosing me, just saying he sees signs of it), which was news to my wife and I. 

I don‚Äôt want to feel like this. My wife and kids deserve better. What has helped you if you feel similar?

(score: 1) | I see. Thanks for the info.

Id say that age would play a bit of a factor. Your still young and a bit generally insecure in who you are.
At the same time, i can fully understand why you would feel this way. 
You're clearly fairly iscolated, in a location, you dont feel like you really fit in. Im guessing, you are not that introverted, more that your hobbies are more calm thoughtful or relaxing, rather than energetic, dopamine type things.

Also if you are an emotional person which again is in no way a bad thing, your more likely to be very thoughtful and wnjoy things like sitting in the sun, going for walks on nature trails or just chilling and watching things. Your conversations will likely also be deeper and more intellectual in nature rather than straightforward and basic. For example, world topics, ethical debates, how things work or simply very in depth discussions over your hobbies.

If you are in a small village, id probably look into either diving deeper into current hobbies and interests or finding things you simply enjoy and really throwing yourself into it. In the long term, you may find a hobby you're super into. This may be one you already have, and your interest in that topic will give you something to talk about to people you feel you have nothing in common with, or you will find people with the same or similar interests and they will become some of your favourite people in your life.

I wouldnt worry to much about fitting in and padding the social statistics. Follow your own interests, invest that time into yourself and the things you love and the rest will work itself out.
If you try to hard to be something youre not, to fit in, you may feel more included, but you wont be happy.

At the end of the day the people around you atm that could be friends, are also likely people you will basically never see again in a few years. Real friends come from common interests or just someone randomly that you just feel comfortable being yourself when you talk to them. If there are people in your life like that currently, they may also just be a bit quiet or nervous and both of you may avoid the awkward scenarios, but if you just say fuck it and get into a passionate talk about interests or even have a debate over a disagreement, you will probably find, that without realising it. You spent all day with them doing nothing in particular and you may decide, it was time well spent and talk more often.


In summary, you probably just feel a little isolated, feel a tad lonely and out of place and generally feel a bit directionless. To all of these things, i wouldnt worry about them too much, invest in yourself and everything else will work itself out.
Try to feel more confident in yourself, you may not gell with the majority, but you are strong and smart enough, to not just follow the heard as it seems easier. In the long run you will end up being a far more emotionally mature person, with depth to them. Rather than these people who peak at 22 and then have no actual personality or interests and become directionless themselves.

Have you ever considered taking an interest in either wildlife or photography, i may be massively off, but considering your location and what you've said, i feel they may be hobbies you could enjoy? (score: 2) | Actually im artist and now i learning some filmmaking stuff (screenwriting, storytelling, video editing ). I learning every day because when i learn something i feel less into philosophy. I have bestie but she too far away from me (I'm not sad) and most of my friends online.

I often after playing games with a mate, would just sit on discord, and talk about random stuff like: can a cuputer ever truelly think for itself, which would lead to the universe being a simulation and on for hours.

Have you ever considered doing film or series watch parties on discord with your friend? Or even maybe finding some random game or activity you could do together in a voice call. That alone will help eith the iscolated feelings.

And i thought to myself that could be one of your hobbies XD, theres certainly a tone of people that will share your interest in that department, it will just be finding the ones that are as interested as you :).
I think you will really enjoy uni, if you go and you will be surrounded by people interested in the same thing. 
It didnt work out for me as my interest just wasnt that strong and the course i ended up on was basically an art course rather than video and sound engineering..... so if you do be very careful, especially when it comes to things billed as media or filmaking.

650,1ddbtu7,Any advice dealing with health condition based frustration?,"Hi,
Im a 25yo M, ive had issues with ankle, knees, and muscular tension as long as i can remember.

Im actually having xrays (again....) soon. This time i do think i actually know what the issue is. Howver the frustration at knowing, and knowing theres nothing i can do but wait around, is driving me crazy.

Im in a bad spell atm. The more physical activity i do, the more crippled i become. Today, i had to crawl down the stairs, lean on every wall, and when i got outside i couldnt go into my outhouse, i had to just flop onto the grass. Then 1 minute later it started raining. So i just had to lie there frustrated as fuck, unable to move, in shorts, getting soaked. All this just to have a joint to reduce the constant mild background pain but mainly to get any kind of comfort. Being uncomfortable and irritable (adhd and sitting still....) is downright depressing me.

651,1ddaszj,Another New Job?,"Again???

I'm not sure I have the strength to even look for a new job, but things keep adding up that make me wonder if I should start looking.

I've been there since March 1st and have not been well received. There was a married man that I was told harasses the women, and he came in, and I waited on him, and then he called back at the credit union to flirt with another woman. This triggered me, and I got very upset about this, and people became upset with me, saying there isn't much they can do. 

Also, no one will give me their cell phone numbers in case I'm running late. They each have one another's phone numbers, and I only have my bosses. 

Today when I went in one girl said you look terrible and I said I was sick. She ran upstairs to tell her mother who is also the CEO who called me and said I better go home before I get everyone else sick to which I said I need the hours I don't have sick time. When I started, 2 women were so sick for weeks. Coughing and sneezing. Blowing their nose. How come they could work while sick?

She said I could come in 2 hours early on Friday. 

Then I began researching, and there's a new law called New York State Paid sick time its mandatory for employers. For every 30 hours worked, one sick hour is accumulated.I texted this to my boss, and she said she'll look into it. 

We are merging with a new Credit Union on July 1st, and I also asked if I can go full-time since this new credit union is looking for a full-time teller.

I was told we will revisit the subject in July. (also our pay will be held the first 16 work days of July due to payroll changes and bi-weekly pay)

For me, it's just kind of adding up and making me feel as if I need to look for a new job.

However, I want to make a smart move and educated move, and I don't want to have to switch jobs as I am 56 this year.

Is this just a normal work environment? Does everyone put up with some sort of crap at their job? 

Maybe I should just stick it out...

How would I know when to leave? I don't want to act too hastily.

Or maybe my MI is causing my perspective to be askew. Maybe I'm over sensitive 

I have had a ridiculous amount of jobs and usually find myself having trouble navigating these types situations, then I quit.

To this day, I feel like I can‚Äôt say I was abused because I wasn‚Äôt beaten up or battered. I feel like I‚Äôm blowing things out of proportion 

My stepdad used to slap me hard around the face when I did something wrong, the one time I remember is when I was about I accidentally took the car keys to the skatepark with me and then I got home and he slapped me in front of my friend.

One time my mum asked me to do something and I replied something which was rude - I can‚Äôt remember what it was but it wasn‚Äôt insulting or anything - then my stepdad stormed upstairs and strangled me against the wall with my legs raised off the ground in front of a different friend.

He also used to sit me down with the door closed and shout at me for about 30 minutes whenever I did something wrong. (Missing bus home for example). What‚Äôs stupid about this is I don‚Äôt remember a word he said but just how it made me feel.

I told my biological dad about this at some point and it got back to my stepdad. Or I might of confronted them when I was a teenager. I can‚Äôt remember. And then it became real - part of the family narrative and my stepdad had to face it.

So now, from time to time, he will joke about how he‚Äôs going to hit me if I do something wrong. In a way that implies that it never happened.

I think this gaslighting is what has lead me to think that it‚Äôs not a big deal.

I am in general disgusted with bodily fluids. Thinking about my own or other people's makes me gag, makes me angry, or literally recoil. I am grossed out by people's existence and the flesh suits we are forced to inhabit. I thought this might be because of contamination OCD or the SPD. I am also very fearful of being touched. 

I struggle with impulse control and that includes with sex. I crave the external validation and have no care in regards to how many people or who it is. I think about it daily and it's overwhelming. I need other people there. I don't like to be alone. 

It feels like there's 2 different people in my head fighting for control over my body. The one ""person"" wants to sleep with everybody and it's hard to think when that one is leading. BUT the other ""person"" who is disgusted with it all instills fear by focusing on the possibility of STDs or negative repercussions of those choices. I imagine the second person with a clipboard giving the first one a lecture. 

I want to also include that when I make a genuine connection with someone, that the disgust for bodily fluids disappears completely. The ones I have for my own body don't, but I find myself WANTING theirs. I don't understand this 180 degree shift. Also as soon as I lose trust for someone, I'm right back to feeling disgusted again.

Usually the second ""person"" wins because the fear is stronger than the desire to sleep with people. It's the only thing that's kept my life semi-functional. I've only had 2 sexual partners in my life and honestly that's amazing considering my circumstances. But it still leaves me feeling out of control and like my head is spinning. It's not like I come out of it satisfied that I've come to some sort of ""good"" conclusion to not have sex in an unsafe way. I usually feel stuck in limbo like I'm unable to act. I feel tired. My head continues to spin and I end up laying in bed. 

It bothers me that it feels like I'm a 3rd wheel to these occurrences. How do I go from being grossed out by people to craving it?

You're not strong, you're not able to do everything by yourself and you dont have it all together. Your human not a robot, you shouldnt have to be. You're a weak, insignificant human struggling with their issues, just like everyone else. You just have more issues or are having a harder time with them atm.
There's nothing wrong with that.

The only advice i can give you, is to stop caring. Im not talking in the way people always go on about, such as social stigma or other peoples thoughts ect. Im saying in general. Stop caring about absolutely everything. The only thing you should give a shit about is yourself. Nobody matters more in your life, than you do. The world is just a simulation, in which you are the main character. This outlook helps a lot when it comes to being more selfish about your own needs.

So ye, stop caring about others or everything except absolute necessities, to keep you afloat e.g: foot, rent and things that make you happy (yes this is a necessity).
Just focus on living your life for a while, get into a very simple routine and dont do things you dont want to do. When your feeling up to it, then you can go about self improvement and fixing issues.

Rest, self reflection, and becoming at ease with how your life is and putting worry aside for a while, is what you really need. Dont burn yourself out, you may feel you need to fix things quickly and that leaving issues to stagnate will make them harder, but trying to deal with these things in a state of high stress and worrying will only make them 20x harder, and at the end of the day running yourself intk the ground physically or mentally, will only make this worse in the long run.

Hope some of this helps at least let you feel more at ease with your current scenario, so it doesnt cause as much stress. Hope, you look after yourself, as if you were consoling a depressed friend. 
You deserve to be treated the same way, so try to treat yourself better. Have convos with yourself in your head or even verbalise them. Its a good first step, to acceptance and will makes for a good rehersal when it comes to talking through issues with friends, family or doctors.

661,1dd9ttj,"Shushing myself or saying ""shut up"" or ""you f***ing idiot"" out loud. What is this?","I can't afford a mental health professional and have mostly been just trying to figure myself out on my own but there are limits to what you can Google. 

I don't remember exactly when it started but the first time I really noticed this.. tick? Was when it started as a head jerk. 

I will be minding my own business and then my brain will decide to bring up a memory of something I did that I feel shame, embarrassment, or guilt about. I am a very visual person, I get lost in my daydreams often they are so vivid. So when I remember something, sometimes it's so vivid that I'm actually relieving the event. And then my head would jerk and I would wince, as if I was trying to literally shake it off. This went on from at least age 20-28, 34 now. It went away for a short period where I was really distracted and feeling okay about myself but then it came back sometime during COVID and it started involving me verbally saying ""Shhhh"" and then it becomes ""shut up!!"" And recently ""you f***ing idiot"" and it's something that it's hard to hide now. It happens all day sometimes. My partner doesn't say much about it but I can tell she's distressed or thinks I'm maybe crazy and I think I'm maybe crazy too. 

I don't know what this is. I don't know if I'm telling the thought to shut up or my past self. It's very distressing. I just want to know what to look into and maybe I can find a way to help myself. Thanks for reading.

You might or might not have it so I said research it. Now, about those ticks, that's just your habit now because that's what stops those daydream and bring you back in reality.

I found a thread from quoara that has the same experiences as you, here‚Äôs the link (score: 2) | Wow, yeah. This is something I do as well but haven't found a way to verbalise what I've been going through. I often do this when I'm really overwhelmed and can't stop thinking about something. I have a really tumultuous relationship with my mum, so if I've just had a horrible fight with her, often I'll end up having a total meltdown and saying over and over to myself things like 'shut up', 'fucking stupid', 'you're an idiot'. It also often has physical components, like smacking my head, hitting myself, tugging on my hair, pacing around, etc. 

I wish I could tell you what it is, but I don't know either. I think for me it might be that a fight with my mum or something similar (feeling rejected by a friend, getting ignored, having someone yell or get frustrated at me, etc.) triggers some traumatic memories and feelings for me, and I react so intensely to those emotions that my body takes over and tries to reject those memories.

It actually lead me towards an autism diagnosis which was a major curveball I was not expecting. I think extended periods of isolation and an obsessive nature just did their work and I just got into this habit of analyzing past interactions and events and criticizing myself. I was bullied really hard as a kid and I had a very scary and unstable home. I think it makes sense that I don't want to remember, I definitely don't anymore. It's a little comforting knowing this happens to other people. It feels really scary like I've lost control of myself or something. (score: 3) | I really relate to your experiences.

I do feel a massive loss of control when I get into these spirals/episodes. I'll make weird vocalisations (like muffled screams, that sort of thing), hit myself, scrape at my face, tug at my hair, etc. - it's exhausting and makes me feel really out of control and crazy.

I believe the other user is correct and I can have something to do with the vividness of maladaptive daydreaming.¬†


My suggestion would be talking to your partner about it. Don't hide it like it is shameful. They can actually help soothe you and break you out of it if they know. Everyone has problems and most people can at least understand that intrusive thoughts or memories are uncomfortable, even if it is not to the same level. You are not crazy.

All the stress has caused me having difficult sleeping, and depression. And that's just from problems I've felt comfortable sharing lol..



I requested some time off from work. 3 weeks to be exact. And btw I requested NON PAID time off. I don't care about the money I'll be losing. I just need time to get myself and my family together. 



The problem is, my employer does ask for medical documentation because this is considered a mental health issue. And the issue is when I asked something similar a few years back, my doctor had a bit of push back, stating I'd have to go to therapy to get that sort if documentation. I tried meds a few years ago and didn't like it as well, so the last thing I want to do is just take pills for depression and sleep. 



I've talked to some friends and family about this and many of them have stated that if my doctor brushes it off again, I need to find another doctor. Because they said it shouldn't be this difficult getting documentation from a doctor stating they are supporting this time off. ESPECIALLY when im not hunting for money or disability. It's just so I don't lose my job.



Now if I take this time off and I'm still in a rough spot, then yea  im open to seeing what other options there are. But for now, I just need to take care of some issues and most of all, spend time with my family.

I am currently a 27 year old male, I have no friends and I live alone because i am single. When i was about 7 years old there was a 2 year stretch of time in my life where I was raped often.

To me, what keeps my going are my passions and dreams. You said you were in university, were you studying something you hate but could be profitable, or something you actually like? My passion is science, not saying I always get the results I want, but knowing I do what I love keeps me motivated (probably ending up poor someday lol).

It at least says a lot about your strenght. Of course you have the means to pass some exams (as an example, but it could be getting through your job aswell), of course you have the possibility to succeed in life.

675,1dd7n38,Need help coping with death anxiety. Desperately.,"I need help coping with death. Desperately. 

I (23M) have been struggling with death anxiety for weeks. I know I‚Äôm not old or anywhere near a natural death, but the fear has taken over my life. I just want help.

It began due to stresses in my life and some family passing last year in both mine and my girlfriend‚Äôs life. I was raised a Roman Catholic but I feel that my scientific education and life experiences has taught me to value verifiable evidence based knowledge. Now the fear of an eternal and absolute non existence consumes me. The fear of a slow death stealing my body and brain control from me until I could no longer said to be alive is a close second.

Since this crisis has begun, I no longer view my life the same. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm acting out the person I used to be, but under the surface I‚Äôve lost passion and love for things that gave me joy. 
I used to exercise 6 times a week and maintain rigorous nutrition regimes, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to do it anymore.

My loved ones support me and offer me comfort, but all I can see when I look at them is how much time they have left on this world and how they will feel as they pass. My girlfriend cherishes me and tells me it‚Äôll be ok, and I try to focus on the life I want together, but all I can picture when I look at her is the thought of saying goodbye to her.

I‚Äôve even had intrusive thoughts of suicide. I rationalise that my fear is a symptom of being a living biological human, but that fear evolves into the idea that since my fear of death is a human construct I might as well experience it now to relieve my fear and pain. The fear pulls me back to clarity.

I‚Äôve been trying to cope. I learn and research about death, from the viewpoint of the sciences and theories/evidence of after life. It all makes me more afraid. Naturalism, Theism, Dualism, Reincarnation. I‚Äôve spoken to priests, friends, family, even my coworkers. I‚Äôve gone to therapy and it hardly helps. I‚Äôve pondered over every argument for how final death wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, but none of it gives me comfort. I‚Äôve even considered hypnotic past life regression therapy to see something to put me at ease.

Please, if anyone can tell me how to deal with these feelings, please.",2,1,new,"Here are current measures I have taken to cope. Warning thats its quite long.

1.	‚Å†Spoken to friends and family about it. (Being with them makes me aware of how many years I have left with them.)
2.	‚Å†Consulted online resources on coping with your own death E.g., appreciating the finiteness of life, understanding that you won‚Äôt perceive nothingness, comparing after death to pre-birth, comparing death to falling asleep. (Doesn‚Äôt calm me in the slightest. I like existing. Going from non-existence to being is an infinitely more gratifying process than going from being to non-existence.)
3.	‚Å†Tried to ignore it. (I couldn‚Äôt. The idea fills me in everything I do, every thought I have, and every person I meet.)
4.	‚Å†Rationalising my death by Biological perspectives. Understanding the process and brain functions during death. (Scared the hell out of me. Slowly losing control of a body and mind I consider to be fit and able now is a worse hell than anything I can imagine.)
5.	‚Å†Studied principles of impermanence and the continuation of the Universe after any one death. (Scares me again. The Universe only matters to me because I exist in it. If I don‚Äôt, in my eyes it never existed. So I don‚Äôt care that it continues after me.)
6.	‚Å†Focus on future goals and life prospects. (Thoughts always turn to future tragedies and losses I expect to suffer. Especially losing my loved ones.)
7.	‚Å†Research and read books on alternative theories of after life and consciousness continuation. E.g., consistency of themes and unexplained biological phenomena seen in near death experiences and deathbed visions and inconsistency with natural brain phenomena, strangely accurate mental mediumship studies by research foundations, and collated reports of children with specific knowledge of ‚Äòpast lives‚Äô that could be verified. (Very comforting for a while. Unfortunately I feel that while science can‚Äôt certainly refute these theories of consciousness, there is probably a biological basis to explain all these phenomena. Created a new fear that whatever I believe in life will be visualised by my brain at death, and for a few seconds/minutes I will see comforting visions before final death and nonexistence.)
8.	‚Å†Therapy and counselling. Helped me understand what in my life caused this fear. Deep breathing techniques calm me for a while. (The fear is still there though.)
9.	‚Å†Church and talking to priests. Received direction on opening myself to spiritual experiences and their accounts of miraculous phenomena they witnessed. (Comforting, but I fear that I am latching on to wishful thinking from my childhood education in religious schools.)
10.	‚Å†Speaking to mental health hotlines. (Helps in the moment to relieve stress.)
11.	‚Å†Desensitising by discussing the topic online and visualising the experience. This is where I‚Äôm at now. (Helps a little bit. I am still afraid especially when thinking about how I will feel in that moment.) (score: 1)",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dd7n38/need_help_coping_with_death_anxiety_desperately/

677,1dd7662,Mild Depression (probably),"TW// SMALL MENTION OF DISORDERED EATING

Hey y'all, F17 here, 

for the last 5 yrs of high school, life has been up and down. Or more like, my home life is fantastic (great parents, travels a lot, comfortably living, steady job, etc etc) but school has just been awful for me. shitty people going behind my back, not a ton of real good friends, I was overweight for the first half of high school and that took a toll on my mental health as well. I've felt very ""Meg Griffin-ish."" not an outcast like her, people talk to me ‚Äî I just have NEVER really been anyone's favourite/first choice, and it has gotten me down. Recently, the thing that has had me REALLY down is my recent breakup.

Because of it, something has changed. I feel like an off switch (?) has been flipped in my mind. Im not suicidal, more like empty, and Im constantly living in the past, and daydreaming about a better school experience/friends. I deleted all of my social medias and unfollowed a bunch of people, I wanna throw away my phone completely and the thought of seeing people I know in my area makes me sick. I literally just want to ""disappear"" and restart my life when I go to university in September, with a clean slate. 

Sometimes after having fun with my only 2 real friends, I'll get home and get overwhelmed with emptiness, then cry. I dont know why, because I genuinely have the time of my life then go home and crash. I struggle with body image still and although I don't s/h, I do starve myself. I sleep normally but lately ive been having disturbing dreams about my ex and I can never seem to get my mind off of the fact that I had so much fun in elementary school, before everyone did me wrong. Im sick of people effing me over and treating me badly.

  
I am not diagnosed (AND NOT ASKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS) but low-key I might ask for therapy. I feel like I have MILD depression at least, or depressive symptoms, because sometimes I cant even function, I sit in my room for hours and fall into a deep dark hole of thoughts and Im sick of it. Im sick of ruining my own fun, especially when other aspects of my life are so good. I wanna go one day without letting the thoughts consume me. Im tired of remembering how badly Ive been treated.

Here's the situation: Yesterday, my parents found out that I changed my name and wanted to become a girl. They sat down with me and launched into a huge lecture about how LGBTQ+ people are all delusional, that I only think this because I have ""too much time to think"", that being LGBTQ+ was going to lead me down a path that ends with drug abuse and AIDS, and that all of my current problems and anxiety were because I strayed from religion. Not only are they forcing me to act like a boy and become religious, they are also not allowing me to pursue my major of choice at a college that I have already applied for (I was in their honors program too) because they are ""worried about the friends I'll make"".

I tried to overdose on Advil because of this (I only had a mild stomachache to show for it). I feel like the parts of me that could feel joy were ground to dust, that the very things that kept me going had disappeared completely. I feel like my parents have no concern for the real me, just their idealized version of a son that they always wanted. And they frame it as a form of caring that is exclusive to unbreakable love of parents, something that they claim I'll never understand until I'm 25. I feel like seriously killing myself, something I hadn't felt for years, and that I am only going to become a bigger threat to myself as time goes on.

I have no idea if my parents are emotionally abusive (serious accusations there), but I know that I want to escape from them. Their line of thinking has caused so much pain, and up until now I was willing to excuse them for it (caregivers are like that, I assumed). Now, I just want to be free of them.",1,0,new,,
680,1dd3zme,I have a weird problem.,"Hi, everyone! This is my first time posting on Reddit. And I'm not how it can help me but I've decided to give it a shot. Before I begin I just wanna say that English is my second language so there might be some grammatical mistakes here and there. This might be long so bear with me.
So my problem began over 2 months ago and it's been making me crazy. Over 2 months ago I heard this bizarre story on YouTube through a story narration channel. You know those channels where they use AI voice to read stories that are written in reddit formats. With the #s for algorithm and no source provided of the original author. Anyways when I found this particular story my gut kept telling me not to view it but curiosity got the better of me and I did and well, it went down hill.
Firstly, I started looking for the source of this story and saw that it was nowhere on Reddit or any other platform. Nobody in the comments could provide a link or confirm if the story ever existed on Reddit. Now, I'm 100% sure the story is fake and was never on Reddit. It has a lot of inconsistencys and plot holes and the premise itself is bizarre. But the problem was that I became obsessed with it. To the point I sort manifested myself as the main character. I started to feel their emotions which were heartbreak, pain, anxiety, betrayal etc. all of these emotions are overwhelming me and I'm sick of it. I wake up in the morning sad and I often get triggers. I picture some of the characters in people around me. And it makes things worse. Even in the last few weeks I was able to thin it down and get over it a bit but my mind keeps relapsing and in the last couple of days it has become hard. I came here because I was very overwhelmed and didn't know what to do.

Now let me give a brief about the story in question. It is a story about a guy who's girlfriend suddenly dissapeard and 5 years later he found out that she had ran off with his brother to Canada and had started a family and his own family( parents, relative's) knew about it and kept it a secret. I know a bizarre plot but the story has a lot of problems such as it has very little relationship dynamics, it has a lot of details missing line the OP never mentioned the comments because if it was a real post people would have asked a lot of questions and the story ends on a weird note which just creates a lot of questions. I don't know why I became obsessed with it because I've red worser stories than this but somehow I became.

Anyways I came to this sub asking for help and will appreciate any help that anybody provide. And also can anybody please help me confirm me that the story titled ""My Girlfriend Disappeared right before my Proposal And 5 Years Later I Find Out She Ran of with my brother"" to see if it's real or not and if it was ever on Reddit? It will help me out a lot. Apparently it was on aita.

Obviously I'm speculating wildly here. But what you've described reminds me a lot of a friend I used to have. I say 'used to' because I ultimately had to step back. They would absolutely use their issues to manipulate the people who cared about them. If one friend shared that they were depressed or struggling to find help, ex-friend would one-up with how much more miserable *they* were. They would frequently take things...not necessarily *out* of context, but they'd stretch it to fit what they already decided. If my ex-friend said ""oh my doctor said not to seek therapy because it's too hard to find someone qualified, can you believe that?!"" I could almost guarantee that the *actual* conversation went something like: 

""Hello, I need a therapist. I have -insert long list of self diagnosed illnesses.""

""Ok, I can set up a referral for you if you want, here are some options.""

""Oh well, they have to be this gender. And this age.""

""Ok, that narrows down the list quite a bit. How about one of these?""

""Oh well I need them to specialize in this random diagnosis and therapy method.""

""Ok, well there are two people on the list that your insurance covers, but they're not your preferred gender or age. you could go outside network, but you'll have to pay out of pocket and they may not be accepting new patients so you may have to wait a few weeks.""

""That's ridiculous, I can't afford that!""

""Well...There are other resources, such as free support groups, self help books and or videos; However, I'm not a therapist myself so I don't have anything specific to recommend to you unfortunately.""

""UGH! You don't even want me to get help. You're just part of the big pharma machine. >:(""

My oldest brother passed away suddenly, had a deep freezer die and needed to be replaced, cat of 10 years has cancer again and vet has given her a couple months left and then to end the month the new deep freezer was accidentally left open over night and several thousand dollars of food was lost.

Meanwhile I've been trying to do what I can to help my sister in law and her two kids as best I can through losing their dad/husband.On top of that I live with my mom because she's in her 60s and in pretty bad health. I am the middle of 5 kids, and kids 4&5 hardly help out even though  live within an hours drive. And kid 2 lives a state away so they aren't able  to help out at all. I cook, clean, and take care of the yard on top of working 40 hours a week, with an hour commute each way.

I feel stuck, trapped, and barely treading water taking care of my mom until she passes because if I don't then she's going to die alone with no one realizing it for weeks, my father passed away 18 years ago. I haven't had a significant relationship in the last 15 years, and it's been a couple of years since I even went on a date. And the worst part of this all, I'm only 36.

I feel like if I do tell a parent or adult, I won't get a say anymore. That's just how my parents are. I don't think they'd let me tell them my exact emotions.

I hit myself a lot, my thighs especially. Sometimes so hard, my muscles feel sore for days and I can barely walk, or other times I get huge bruises on them. Many times it‚Äôs felt like my fingers got bruised too. Idk what to do with it. I don‚Äôt want to be angry all the time and I don‚Äôt want to hurt myself, but I feel like it keeps happening more since I lost my mom a few months ago. Anyone have any advice?",1,1,new,"**Hello u/!**

701,1dcw66j,"have been lying to my psychiatrist about my real issues because i‚Äôm scared, what do i do?","I‚Äôm nervous about posting this because truly at this point I have nobody to talk to regarding this that I think may understand? So..I will try to explain everything to the best to my ability. I [18F] have been diagnosed with AD(H)D, an unspecified anxiety disorder & depression, BUT this is only because my parents just wanted me to get a 504 help plan in school because I can‚Äôt focus, so that‚Äôs why they got the psychiatrist in the first place. 

But this is where it started getting worse, I know I have more issues than this, but i‚Äôm horrified to get help. Before I started seeing this psychiatrist, she met with my parents and they filled out a form with characteristics I met, and I asked my sister about it when they showed it to her and she had told me that they had lied on portions of it relating to more problems because they only wanted an ADHD diagnosis (such as possibly having autism, suicidal ideation, blah blah blah)

Our meetings have been normal because my psychiatrist just wants me to finish school which is why I‚Äôm seeing her, but I want to tell her my real issues like the things that have been going on at home. My mom is a huge alcoholic and drug addict, and it gets really bad on a nightly basis; she screams and screams and nobody does anything and we can‚Äôt get her help even though we‚Äôve tried. She has constantly abused me emotionally and mentally, mostly due to the fact I‚Äôm behind in credits for school, I don‚Äôt have my license yet (working on it now that it‚Äôs summer) and the fact I have a girlfriend. My sister recently cut me off too because of my moms actions, so I can‚Äôt talk to her about all these things. I do have really bad issues with self-harming to cope with these things in my life or I punish myself to go without sleep. 

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist later today, but I‚Äôm so scared of telling her about these things, specifically the self-harming & asking for pills that work? Because she has prescribed me anxiety pills that are only meant to be used in emergency situations, but I‚Äôve gone through them because it‚Äôs everyday that I have panic attacks at this point and I truly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm even capable of being helped as I have been deemed as a failure by everyone in my life. I feel so horrible and guilty that I‚Äôve lied to her about everything being fine when it‚Äôs not, I don‚Äôt want her to think i‚Äôm crazy or even send me to an inpatient facility because my mom has convinced me that‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna happen and that my issues aren‚Äôt as bad as hers. 

I plan to tell her today but I know i will break down so very bad in her office, i‚Äôm scared that i will look like an attention seeker, but I hate feeling the way I have been every single day. Moving out isn‚Äôt an option, living with anyone else isn‚Äôt either, I‚Äôve talked to my dad about my moms issues but he doesn‚Äôt understand her and lets her get away with all of this stuff because she is very disabled. This turned into a vent so I apologize, I just don‚Äôt really know what to do and want to see if anyone has any advice?",1,1,new,"EDIT: I forgot to add that the psychiatrist I have been seeing is labeled as specializing with kids (I‚Äôve been seeing her since I was 17) and she was willing to keep me as a patient until I finished highschool, so I‚Äôm unsure if it would be best to get one meant for adults? I don‚Äôt know how that stuff works and my parents don‚Äôt like elaborating or getting into that stuff because they dislike talking about mental health and/or think i‚Äôm downplaying my issues, which is why i get so nervous and scared.

702,1dcvx6j,Grounding? Struggling to keep going.,"Hello all,

I suffer from general anxiety and clinical depression (have been on medication for 32 years) and am going through a really bad depressive and anxiety episode at present. This is not my first episode.

I have access to a psychologist via work and she has advised to use grounding techniques when the bad / intrusive / suicidal thoughts occur.

However, I'm struggling to find one which works. 
I've tried the 3-3-3 and 5-4-3-2-1 techniques but I am still thinking the other thoughts while doing these.
I only find it takes me a few seconds to complete these and then the bad thoughts continue.

She suggested touching something physical e.g wedding ring but doesn't help either.

I've tried mindfulness but I cannot find 'now' 

Whether I am doing something wrong or I am utterly useless (more likely the case)

Today started as being very  anxious without being able to feel why. I've been going downhill to rock bottom since.

I thought I was doing better as I had 3 consecutive days without suicidal thoughts.

My psychologist wants to try EMDR but I can't  remember any trauma and have no reason to believe there is any. I have no reason to believe that my childhood wasn't generally happy. Therefore would EMDR work.

I have tried CBT several times but it never seems to work for me. I am a generally logical but the same logic that I would apply to others doesn't apply to me. I feel I am not worthy of it and am worthless, useless and a waste of space.

At present I feel too broken to be fixed this time.

704,1dd7obu,Need support/help - depressive episode ,"Hi friends. I (20F) am posting on here this evening because I am in a bit of a depressive slump and I don't know what to do. For context, I have had some physical health issues for about 1.5 months consisting of extreme fatigue, headaches, body aches, etc (I have no diagnosis yet but possibly anemia?). With these physical symptoms have come some uncomfortable mental symptoms including sadness, loneliness, lack of motivation, worthlessness, low self-esteem, brain fog, etc. I essentially want to stay in my bed and cry all day, but I have two jobs and multiple other commitments so I am unable to do so. I have been sleeping through alarms, missing plans, and have not been responding to texts/emails.

I don't know what to do. I've had depressive episodes before but I've kinda just endured them (also I am on some anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications so those have helped in the past). I have a great supportive circle of friends and loved ones, but I feel like a bother when I seek comfort from them.

I would really appreciate any help, support, or advice that anyone on here is willing to give me. Thank you and I hope you all have a good week <3",3,5,new,"I struggle with not wanting to be a burden too, I perfectly get you. 

My advice would be to try and reach out to the people that you feel are closer to you or that you trust the most.  Even a simple ""hey I'm not doing well"" is enough to relieve a bit of weight on your mind and heart. They may not be able to help with everything, but they will be willing to try.

I know it's hard to reach out, especially when having a depressive episode, but those people love you and will be glad you asked them for help instead of keeping everything inside. Make sure and feel free to establish boundaries, if you are not up for, e.g., ""games and pizza"" or whatever plan they might have to cheer you up, tell them. If you just want to sit with them on your couch and watch junk tv or parallel play, tell them. They will be happy to be there for you.

I for years have had felt horribly depressed and had suicidal thoughts, a few years ago i started working with this woman and we became friends.  I felt so much better talking to her and being around her, we had mutual respect for eachothers work and made a good team.  

After about a year and a half she stopped talking to me very suddenly one day and after a few months of that she became aggressive and hostile towards me.  To the point that she got in trouble with management over it.  She had gotten into trouble for other things, a lot of sudden drama and fighting with people, but her hostility towards me seemed to be especially bad and i never got a real explanation for it.  She ended up being fired because nobody wanted to work with her.  Her absolute best work trait was being cooperative and coordinating between multiple departments and people and getting help from a full circle of people, and then she became hostile and withdrawn.  I felt so horrible and guilty when she was let go that it made me physically ill, this happened towards the end of last year.  I tried to call her to see if she was ok, but she had blocked my number.  

It all just keeps running around in a circle in my head, i can't understand it.  I feel like i've crashed and lost something in myself, like that was the last little bit i had left to give.   

I had made this world up in my head to think about when i was trying to go to sleep, a simple place, a camp by the beach where it was always raining, i had built it up in my mind a little at a time, added locations, characters, events, it all just helped me relax and fall to sleep.

And today my mom found me smoking cigarettes and the guilt is making me sick. Until now I am always feeling that guilt of failing, having no fun and buying things I love which are not necessary. I know I should be saving money which I do, I just buy things sometimes and go out sometimes with friends cause my parents are very strict and they worry about me spending too much money and also my safety. 
Idk what to do I‚Äôm not able to focus on my studies and feel like a failure everyday. I feel guilty when I go out with friends, when I eat out without my family, having fun and even being out late. This is making me hard to commit to a relationship and be open to my close ones.

I‚Äôm a recovered addict, never wanted to get sober or be here. Pushing through for my loved ones. Never planned to live past 18. Anyways I did, so I‚Äôve just been sort of winging it, so far that‚Äôs working great. Was starting to do a lot better in the head and setting up a very good life for myself. Earlier this year I found my abusive partner, he drove me to the brink of absolute insanity. Destroyed me and brought me down to rock bottom. I‚Äôm using again, suicidal, struggling. Trying to leave him. I made it 3 days, he tried to come back today. 


   I stupidly answered his text and once again he had me right back down. I hit my breaking point today. Tied the noose, was just waiting for the tire guy to finish up on my car outside. Went out to pay him, gave him half in cash and was planning to do the rest on debit. He told me not to worry about it. That one act of kindness saved my life. Went inside, took it down and flushed the pills. Turned off my location, social media‚Äôs are paused and I‚Äôve relocated. So he can‚Äôt find me and disturb my healing.

720,1dd2qz8,Illogical anxiety stemming from my job,"I'm working at a research center for my summer job as an over-the-phone interviewer. The content of the research isn't pertinent to this, but it's a legitimate research effort that's been going on for some time. I haven't been there for very long, and I need some advice for confronting these fears.

Making calls is the hard part, for no good reason whatsoever. It's genuine research, the people on the other end will never know who I am, and it's fairly simple. Whenever I actually make the calls, my heart just races. I feel anxious. Anxiety apparently runs in the family, but usually I can quell mine with logic. This time, I can't. I don't know why. Be it reminding myself that I'm just doing my job, that they have no idea who I am, or that they have nothing personal against me, nothing works. It's confusing and infuriating. I can't even talk to random people over the phone without feeling a bottomless pit in my stomach.

I'm afraid to do a literally innocuous task and I don't know why. I almost feel like I've lost, reaching this far for any kind of support, because I can't just get rid of it this time. I'm scared that this feeling won't leave. Anything is appreciated, here or in DMs.",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dd2qz8/illogical_anxiety_stemming_from_my_job/

However, tonight, just half an hour ago, he opened up to me about how he hates himself and wants to kill himself every day. He says hes so fed up with life, and hes completely given up, he just puts up an act everyday. I, personally struggle with the same thing sometimes, but it hurts to hear it from someone that i really care about. I thought i would know how to talk to someone with the same struggles, but i dont. I have no idea how to comfort him. A few minutes ago he said that he will go to sleep, but he said it as if it was a goodbye and im scared that hes actually going to do hurt himself.

722,1dd41in,All of my ambitions seem impossible and I'm kind of numb about my passions.,"My biggest ambition above all else is to have a wife who loves and respects me for me. The woman I was with for some time showed me neither of those were ever present from her.

My next ambition was to succeed at starting a business. Even if it failed, successfully start one. Had the business registered, had distribution set up, software in place, and was set to give the manufacturer the green light to ship us the first 10 units. But, with the depression and corresponding alcoholism from the breakup I had to put a pause on things. Which is essentially the graveyard for startups.

If I couldn't be successful at business with my ideas, I could at least create them. Collecting royalties on patent work could keep me afloat and getting to create new ideas has always been my dream (only behind a loving wife who respects me). I successfully was granted a patent, of a technology my business was going to leverage.

But, in the past, I used to have passion about new ideas. I'd work on one, then move on to the next if the first proved futile. I don't like to bring it up too much, but, I have Aspergers. So, when I hyper fixated on something I was spending weeks forgetting to eat or leave the house because of some new idea. The last handful of years and especially recently I haven't gotten passionate about any project. I'll work on something and get interested in it. But, my eyes won't light up when I talk about it.

Women have told me I'm attractive and sweet and well put together, so, my last resort was to just give up and seek comfort in the hollow love I can receive by becoming a womanizer. I studied up on what they do and how they do it, spent a couple months figuring out how I personally could go about having someone to hold for the night, then set it into practice. End of story, I blew through money on drinks for months and proved to myself I am abysmal at speaking to anyone in a casual manner.

I have failed my first three ambitions and couldn't succeed at the ambition I settled for after them. My depression is running rampant in a cycle that worsens itself as the only way to silence the suicidal ideation is with alcohol, which of course makes the depression worse. The awkwardness of my Aspergers seems to be manifesting itself prolifically whilst the passionate pursuit of random subjects seems to have abandoned me completely.

Depression can be an illness (score: 9) | Yep, the two can often be intertwined (score: 2) | For me it comes down to a sense of hopelessness. When I‚Äôm depressed, I feel hopeless with no motivation or energy for anything. Just stuck in a negative mindset where I can only focus on the worst. When I‚Äôm just feeling unfulfilled, I know what I need to change to shift into a better situation and I‚Äôm hopeful something will change so I can feel more aligned with myself and my purpose. (score: 4) | For me, being depressed is having no interest in life. I don't want to be dead, but I'm completely checked out.

I don't really feel unhappiness because I don't experience happiness either. My emotions are basically nothing. (score: 3) | Read the dsm criteria for depression. That‚Äôs the difference. Being unhappy can be a reason for it or symptom of it but there‚Äôs more criteria. (score: 2) | Icecream cures sadness. It doesn't cure depression. 

But more seriously, go and see your GP for a diagnosis. (score: 2) | i might not be accurate as this is coming from my own experience but how i personally would tell the difference is that depression is something that slowly takes over your life, that being day to day. you slowly stop doing the things you enjoy, u stop socialising, u lose motivation etc. it definitely ranges from person to person. you definitely get ur good days and bad days, but you seem to get alot more bad days then good. while feeling unfilled in life, i would assume your life feels like theres something missing, you feel like you should be doing more with your life. ur lost and are unsure what to do, this is something that can lead into depression, but theres a big difference between it slowly taking over your life and just wanting to do more. (score: 1) | when ure unhappy u dont feel hopeless and still have the urge to do something about it. yk actually have the urge to act on it and want change. when ure depressed u dgaf (score: 1) | But eventually some people do gaf, does their depression go away and that's how they can now gaf? Not being sarcastic or that genuinely asking. (score: 1) | well it‚Äôs great when they start to gaf bc it means they‚Äôre trying to pull themselves slowly out of depression just like small baby steps (score: 1) | For me depression is something that can take over almost every aspect of your life. You could be doing everything right and changing your lifestyle and you will still be unhappy. 
But usually unhappiness in life in general can come from things like work or maybe your just not taking care of yourself. Usually something you can pin down. But with depression its harder to pin down what is really causing it. (score: 1) | Both can be true at the same time.. When you're ""fufilled"" you feel better but ultimately what does that even mean for you? career? friends? personal growth? relationship? Depression sucks but can do your best to work out of it by doing things you like.

732,1dd50is,Can't be myself,"People have historically always said ""Just be yourself and people will like you."" ""Just be yourself and you'll make friends."" But this factually isn't true, and I'm living proof of this. It's been taking a toll on my mental health. I feel completely alienated from other people in general, I feel like I can't keep a single friend or have any meaningful friendship, and I just feel alone.

Every time I meet someone and just 'be myself' it always takes a turn for the worst. I'm too negative, people don't seem to like what I have to say, and the relationship always becomes toxic and crashes. I've tried being fake around people, never giving opinions, acting collected and keeping myself together, being shy and quiet, but then I can never tell anyone anything and the relationship stays shallow, then eventually ends. I can't be fake because being fake results in no real friendships, but I can't be real because I'm just genuinely a horrible person that people hate more and more as they get to know me.

I could try to 'work on myself', but then that'd inadvertently be proving that 'being yourself and you'll get friends' is a complete lie. I don't want to have to change every faucet of my being just to fit in with humanity, because I am who I am. If I have to change to fit in at all, then that just means I'm not welcome here. There really is no winning no matter how I think of it, and it's all extremely upsetting. Sometimes I think I should just give up on friendships and be some cringy 'lone-wolf' type that doesn't need anyone, but I already know that's physically impossible because I'm a human being that needs social interaction.

Overall, I dunno. I dunno what type of replies I'm expecting from this either. I'm pretty positive nothing anyone says will help, and saying ""It's OK, everything will be alright, we all feel this way sometimes."" is just a generic non-helpful answer that'll only piss me off more. I just had to say all this somewhere, and I do hope somebody cares enough to respond somehow.",3,2,new,"**Hello u/!**

i often have troubles figuring out what to talk about when in conversation, it helps me to have a mental list of conversation starters and things to talk about, my first favorite is pets, those conversations are always fun, plus i‚Äôll likely to get to see cute pet pictures! other than that i‚Äôll talk about games or shows i‚Äôve been playing/watching and asking them to share what they do in their free time as well

734,1dd4u7n,i‚Äôm slowly realizing that i‚Äôm actually not okay,"My anxiety has played a big role in my life for the past couple of years. I‚Äôm the type of person that would rather deal with it myself than ask someone for help because ‚Äúit‚Äôll pass or go away‚Äù. so, right before the pandemic and soon after i had actually spiraled. we had gone on a family trip and while at a hotel i had a panic attack and could not leave the hotel room. i sought out counseling and it was okay for a while.

Fast forward last year, perhaps the worst year of my life and the year that changed my life. we found out that my dad had been cheating on my mom‚Äî i was a big daddy‚Äôs girl growing up and my life changed completely after that. i never expected it to affect my anxiety but it did.

i began to worry about dumb things like what my family is thinking about us, how they perceive us, what my dad is doing now with his ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô, does he have another family now, will we eventually cut all contact with him??? will i never have an actual father figure in my life?? i assumed that they where insignificant fears that i was imagining but a few months into this year I started to notice a difference in me ‚Äî and specifically in my thought process. 

i‚Äôve begun to think a LOT about self harm‚Ä¶ specifically things like ‚Äòwhat if i offed myself right now before anyone came home?‚Äô or ‚Äòwhat if i took a little too much medication and yknow‚Ä¶ make it or didn‚Äôt make it?‚Äô i HATE it, never have i ever in my life EVER thought about things like that.. it terrifies me so much that i get severely anxious thinking about it.

also.. another thing that‚Äôs recently been in my mind aside from the previous topic is hurting someone else. i feel so disgusted with myself for even THINKING about hurting someone and even worse someone close to me (someone who genuinely loves me and looks after me). my anxiety has now spiraled out of fear that i might hurt myself or someone else‚Ä¶

i honestly don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs common to think about stuff like this or if it correlates with  anxiety but i‚Äôm going through it‚Ä¶ any thoughts?
",1,2,new,"Well, this happens to everyone. You have new experiences everyday that shape your personality. Everyone has to go through some difficult phases in life too. Thoughts of self harm and harming others are the extreme end of negative emotions, and it's normal. But allowing yourself to always think in extreme terms is not good.

Your mind works in patterns and once you've got the habit of thinking about self harm, your natural response to any stress in life would be self harm. So don't indulge in that first.

Second, stop being attached to your past. Things change. Obviously they might not always be as you expect them to be. All you need to do is to stop being on the extreme end of thoughts. 

Third, about your father. He prioritised himself and was selfish with his decisions. But this is how most people are around us , isn't it? Yeah we do expect our loved ones to care about our feelings but they are not bound to. You'll face this situation multiple times in life.

All you gotta do, is just let everything go. Don't hold on to your past and your idea of a happy family. It didn't come out as you wish. Accept it as a fact and just let it go.
Prioritize your happiness above everything now. Meet people and have fun. Everyone got their own mind and their own mouth. Don't worry about what they're gonna think and talk about you, it's none of your business and it's just worthless. 
Infact you should be thankful that this one incident with your father would bring out so many narrow minded thinkers around you and you'll know who to avoid.

Just let go of your past, accept it and move forward. Find reasons to engage yourself and progress.

You are BOTH the narrator and the observer, you're having the thought but you're also the one judging the thoughts. You're disgusted by your violent thoughts, that's probably a good thing. As far as the suicidal thoughts go if you find yourself ruminating on it you need to steer your thinking into something you like thinking about or something that takes a lot of mental energy, same goes for any other non-useful negative self talk. 

After my mom killed herself I was rendered unable to fantasize about suicide without thinking about her death, how it effected everyone, and how it would effect the people that care about me.

For eg, once i gagged real loud cause the trash smelled bad. And that exact soundbite of my gag was just playing over and over the rest of the day.

Is this just an anxiety thing? Cause I've noticed it only happens with things said or sounds made by people in a distressing or angry way.

I'll start hearing people calling my name angrily, random yells or screams of a family member scolding someone, or crying. Or just phrases like ""Don't do that!!!"" ""Look here!!"" ""Please!!!

736,1dd4gso,Any thoughts? Currently really struggling. ,"I started college last fall expecting it to be life changing in the best way possible but quickly found out that what was going to happen was going to be the complete opposite of that. I always struggled with making friends due to my personality and the area I was from and my family dynamics, I had a few but none of them I would really call best friends but my senior year of high school I really thrived socially, academically, and honestly just in every way possible. I felt really good and felt like I was on track to doing what I really wanted to do in life. But anyway I went off to a small college in Missouri and less than a month into college I went through something super traumatic that my friends (term used loosely) basically set me up in and let it happen. Since then I have been diagnosed with PTSD and I have always struggled with anxiety, depression, and OCD, but ever since then everything has just gotten so, so much worse. I went from being valedictorian of my class in high school to failing a class my first semester and not being able to keep an A my entire first year of college. I know people say you shouldn't compare high school coursework to college coursework because it is harder but it really does just make me feel like I‚Äôm really setting myself up for failure. None of my family knows what happened and I have basically no friends anymore because everyone stopped talking to me after I got so depressed and the one person that i would've called my best friend (was not there when incident happened) told me that what happened was my own fault and she didn't want to deal with me anymore and ghosted me. I have two friends that I talk to pretty consistently and they genuinely have tried helping me through everything but I'm just feel like they don't get it enough to even help me and that makes me feel extremely guilty. I just feel scared because now I feel like even the two friends that have tried helping me are just getting tired of me because I'm not getting any better and I can feel them pushing away, every time I try to talk about how l'm feeling they change the subject completely so now I have no outlets except for therapy, which is good I guess but I would prefer at least one person in my personal life I could talk to. I don't want to expect that they should listen because I know it's probably hard to hear nothing but negativity from me all the time and I don't want them to feel pressured into hearing it because the last thing I would ever want to do is make them upset. I just feel so alone and like nothing is ever going to get better for me and I feel so stuck. I have no goals anymore and no one to turn to and it's just so hard and the worst feeling in the world. A lot of the time I feel like I'm being dramatic and blowing things out of proportion and I just need to move on like everyone else, but it's just so hard. Sorry I probably rambled on for so long, there's a lot more to the story but I will stop there for now. Thanks.",1,1,new,"Hey, I see you and get it. I also had a very hard time with the transition to uni, albeit for different reasons, but a lot of what you said resonated with me, especially the part with the two friends and worrying about the effect you'll have on them. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I can really give you good advice, but what I know is that a lot of my issues went away for a couple of weeks. I struggled to understand it at the time, but I think it may have been because I was doing a lot of the stuff they tel you to do when you're depressed. I was getting exercise, eating healthy, taking time for self-care and so on. I guess it can genuinely have an effect. Maybe journaling could also help you so that you have an additional outlet or something creative to get some emotion out? I know that doing all this stuff can be hard when you're feeling the way you are and it's fair if you feel like you can't manage it, but maybe find ways you can gradually introduce healthy habits? Like rather than worry about cooking healthy meals that involve a lot of work, just make sure you eat at least one piece of fruit today or for the exercise just start with five minutes of things that you enjoy and are good at. And regarding grades, remember that it isn't just the course that is difficult, but your mental state can really mess with academic performance.

751,1dd1ocj,Friend thinks his entire well being rests on him getting his job back,"So prior to this I‚Äôve already made a few posts in this subreddit about a specific friend. If you‚Äôd like more context about him I‚Äôd go and read my other posts as they would help you get a better feel for his mental state. 

So here‚Äôs the story; nearly six months ago my friend was fired from a job he really loved and had for nearly three years. He‚Äôs the kinda person that needs human interaction and energy. Now I will say up to this point he was in his ‚Äúhermit‚Äù stage, even by his own admission. Pretty much his anxiety and depression has gotten so bad he almost never leave the house, he would say yes to anyone invite him out but not go or come up with an excuse at the last minute. This job was pretty much the only thing that got him out of the house. But even then it was exercise. He‚Äôs in a place where he can get easily distracted or triggered. He‚Äôll spend three hours getting ready for work but leave the door when his shift started in 5mins. Other little things where his boss wasn‚Äôt treating him the nicest, he was sort of forced into a manager role,many times being left alone for hours on end. 

How he wasn‚Äôt fired for tardiness alone is beyond me. Anyway fast forward to this past December, he was kinda pressure sto participate in a Secret Santa and one a persons list they asked for a Twisted Tea. The lists went through management, nothing was said. My friend even asked their security if it was fine. They said it as long as it wasn‚Äôt opened or consumed on the premises. Fast forward after the fact the boss finds the Twisted Tea opened in their break room fridge. Never caught my friend drinking on the job, nor was he; but was fired because he brought it in. Now this was Christmas Week 2023. Almost 6 months. My friend has been trying to create some sort of letter to get his job back, laying out what‚Äôs been happening to him, making a plea. Personally I think he‚Äôs waited too long; so much so he could probably just reapply. 

I can‚Äôt see any HR company taking his letter legitimately justified or not. It‚Äôs just a greeting card store at the mall. But I think having that job was ‚Äúkeeping him together‚Äù and losing it destroyed everything. Since then his been home alone every single day with little to no interaction from anyway. Every time I come it like word vomit because I‚Äôm usually eh first person he interacts with. We have other roommates but they keep to themselves. So I think he‚Äôs attributing the job to the downfall of many things as his mental health has gotten steadily worse. He claims he‚Äôs been trying to get a new job but I question it cause he never leaves the house. Unless they‚Äôre all zoom interviews but again idk. I think it‚Äôs time for him to move on but he won‚Äôt see reason",2,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dd1ocj/friend_thinks_his_entire_well_being_rests_on_him/

If anything, it actually made me worse due to my ODD. I have other mental issues that may have contributed to that too, but I‚Äôm pretty confident that my ODD was the biggest issue. 

What I found to help me the best was learning about mental health in general, learning more about my specific diagnosis‚Äô, taking random free psychology courses online, and finding free resources online (whether that be workbooks, posters, etc.). With that information, I became quite aware of the things I do and how I respond, and have learned how to make better choices with everything that I do. I also have a huge interest in mental health/psychology, so I got to expand on my general knowledge, as well as learn more about myself, what I do, why I do it, how to change it, etc etc. I do still struggle, but I am wayyy better than I use to be, and I am beyond grateful for that!

I agree with you on that last part though! I‚Äôve always wanted to be a therapist (it will stay a dream, I‚Äôm a bit too gone mentally to do that lmao), but I feel like if given the proper resources to do so and if we had to fill out something to explain our experiences and situations and everything else, we‚Äôd be better off diagnosing ourselves and then just having it confirmed by a professional. Other people only know what we tell them and there‚Äôs absolutely no way to know exactly how a person feels (you can only have an idea of how they feel), and if we had something to lay it all out on paper (like literally lay it all out, all problems, emotions, reactions, behaviors, etc), without being under pressure or feeling some way having to talk about it, we‚Äôd be more better diagnosed and treated.

Yea, unfortunately getting ‚Äúhelp‚Äù from these people, the majority of time, doesn‚Äôt feel genuine. It‚Äôs all based on money, and having one 45 minute session every week isn‚Äôt going to solve the deep, underlying issues. 

Plus, a therapist is a guide, they‚Äôre supposed to be a ‚Äúcoping tool‚Äù to help you see things in different perspectives. The reality of it is only you know yourself the best, you can only understand your own trauma (a lot of people can‚Äôt, which is another issue altogether, but it‚Äôs still going to be there), and only you can truly change yourself as a human.

Not to say it doesn‚Äôt fuckin suck for the first year or so‚Ä¶ the amount of trauma you end up facing and moving through is so intense. However, I‚Äôd go through those hard years over and over if I had to because where I am now is worth it. 


And I highly suggest trying out different therapist if the first doesn‚Äôt work out, try not to get on meds right away because even though ppl throw diagnosis‚Äôs at you especially with a Psychiatrist, it‚Äôs really important to work slowly towards that so you can see what is actually going on. 

It takes time to be properly diagnosed.

But be patient and gentle with yourself, this is a tough journey but you are understanding yourself on a whole different level. (score: 4) | I tried twice. Once while in college and the therapist just pushed meds on me and they made me really sick. 

The second time I felt like I just talked and talked and they would just stare at me sympathetically or ask me questions but never really offered any good advice on how to tackle my problems. 

I might try once more but so far I have not enjoyed my experiences. (score: 3) | I never tried therapy just being my own doctor and also I relay on my friends. I don‚Äôt know about everyone but the thought of money I need to pay for therapy is so expensive :( (score: 2) | YES. Granted it may take time to find the right therapist (pls research the diff types of therapy before shopping for one) 

I honestly wish I could mandate two years of therapy for everyone Right after highschool. 

Therapy provides me clarity and peace of mind. (score: 2) | It depends, when you try on your part and have a good therapist, it can be very helpful. But if you aren‚Äôt willing to try, than not really.¬†
Currently im doing talk therapy to help me understand myself better.¬† (score: 2) | I would say therapy is for everyone, it‚Äôs just a matter of finding the right therapist for you. I always say therapy is like dating, you need to date around and try out a few before you settle. Find the one that matches your personality and needs, but there‚Äôs one out there for everyone for sure. (score: 2) | Yes, therapy was a transformative experience for me. It helped a lot, to the point where I have a functioning life; I feel happier and no longer need to go to therapy. Definitely recommend looking into it! (score: 2) | I have probably spoken to 5 therapists but only one really helped me.   My child talked to at least 3.  One was really good. (score: 2) | I think therapy is a space to share your feelings in a professional setting with someone who shares no relations or bias towards you. It‚Äôs a nice welcoming space when you find the right person. I went to therapy and enjoyed it but it still left me how I felt when I first came in.  I wanted answers on how to move forward with life after my experience, and I‚Äôm still unsure on how to move on. (score: 2) | Yes, and yes (score: 1) | Its been helping a lot. Specially because she is also the one that prescribes me the meds, so she listens to me, observes, sees changes and then decides if we continue with the same meds or not. (score: 1) | Yes, I have learned some skills and get relief from feeling heard. (score: 1) | Absolutely it helps! It‚Äôs not easy. It‚Äôs work. But it helps. (score: 1) | in some way, yes (score: 1) | Doing it currently and it's been a big help in keeping me sane (score: 1) | I‚Äôve done it a bunch and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs done much to improve my situation. But it is nice to have someone to share some of my darker thoughts with and not feel like I‚Äôm burdening or freaking out my friends or family. (score: 1) | I was the poster child for not going to therapy cus of social stigma assigned to it. I was very wrong, it was one of the better decisions I‚Äôve made, only stopped cus my money had to go to other things for a while. (score: 1) | For me it worked at the beginning but after a while I felt like it was just making me worse than I was before I went. I started going to therapy in July of 2017 and it was needed from a foster care system. Since I was thinking about hurting myself because of my situation I was going through. I really enjoyed my therapist but I felt like it was just making me feel trapped because of what the foster care system did to me at age 14. Once I got back to my mom's custody (it took 8 months for them to say it was a mistake to remove us) I was put into family therapy. It was just something that caused more issues for me as a person. The only good thing that came out of going to therapy was being diagnosed with PTSD and OCD. I wouldn't change the past because it made me who I am today. It might be good for other people but in my situation it wasn't. I'm sorry if that was worded weirdly since I'm currently heading to bed. But I still wanted to make a statement. But good luck on your own journey. I believe in you (score: 1) | Yes. In my opinion it helps me a tiny bit because I get to vent and then have outside conversations. I get to know about the medications I‚Äôve been on and get advice on things that have been troubling me (score: 1) | I have tried it but sadly it did not work. My social anxiety was to much that the therapist couldn‚Äôt really help me, due to the fact that I would not talk and felt to nervous to do the anxiety techniques that she was showing me in front of her. I do hope the try again soon as iv been better at managing it lately. Though I know this route isn‚Äôt for everyone. (score: 1) | It took me many years and multiple therapists to be able to find one that helps. Everyone responds differently and has different preferences as to what works for them. After a lot of research I found a therapist that I adore. I needed to find someone who had experience in all of my issues which is not easy to find. We have accomplished a lot over the years. I‚Äôm a hot mess with a list of mental illnesses that would send most running for the hills. He covers all my issues, he‚Äôs kind, and he‚Äôs caring. I know myself well enough to know I need to feel like my therapist cares. I have come a long way and I actually look forward to our sessions. (score: 1) | It honestly really depends on your therapist. I worked with someone who I would barely use 30 mins of my 60 min session bc I felt she wasn't understanding of my situation - I am Punjabi and she was White. Now I have a S. Asian therapist and I kid you not I feel I can talk to her about anything. (score: 1) | From my experience, both individual and group therapy worked. Be prepared to do the work though and be committed. It is going to get worse before it gets better. (score: 1) | I am a therapist and I make sure that I go for therapy quite consistently. There are lot of responsible therapists who do that so that their own issues don‚Äôt disturb their presence with their clients
And to answer your question, I have been going for therapy for years and it has benefited me in ways I can‚Äôt even imagine (score: 1) | It helped me but in part because I was very isolated at the time and having someone to talk to in my life other than my own thoughts  pulled me back from weird mental places. 

If it wasn't for the isolation I don't think it would have helped me much. I didn't hear any brilliant insight about my issues I couldn't get elsewhere.  But I got human face to face communication about my issues which mattered to me at the time. (score: 1) | I tried with many therapists but its mostly helping for that moment to talk to someone, it doesnt give me much anything. Its not better in any way than talking to free emotional support volunteer. Pretty much most of them are useless, sometimes they even make me feel worse. Rn after 5 years of therapy im probably worst mentally than I ever been. But w/e i dont know how else should i cope so i go there because I dont want to kill myself. (score: 1) | Started at 12. I'm 33. So far, not much. Can't hold a job. At least it got me out of the house, but meh. I'm not too optimistic right now. I'm curious too though, of what can help (score: 1) | I tried therapy (because of anxiety) with two different therapists and..... Not really. Nothing really changed. The only thing that really helped me were antidepressants (score: 1) | I try 4 therapist.
except one of them that she is my therapist for 4 years, all of them cuases many bad thoughts and confused me.
Choosing therapist is so important and critical. (score: 1) | I have been in/out of therapy my whole life. Nothing moved the needle faster towards healing than the mental fitness training from the book positive intelligence (score: 1) | It didn't help but that's bc I think CBT isn't for me.¬† (score: 1) | It works if you find the right therapist. At the time I needed therapy, this one therapist helped me without even charging me one cent. He helped me because I wanted to help and I felt it, Thursdays was my favorite day because of him and because how good I felt when i talked to him. I grew a lot thanks to him and even though he had to move to Italy and our schedules just didn‚Äôt work anymore he helped me FOR FREE for 6 months. 
After that I eventually went with another therapist that my company paid for and it wasn‚Äôt the same.
You just need to find the right one.


P.S. I did eventually send him all the money I could even though he was in Italy but I felt like I had to repay him. (score: 1) | I have gone through two rounds of therapy and yes it helped. It's worth the time and money. (score: 1) | I have had few sessions of Therapy since last month. And honestly it helped a lot. 

TBH I cannot talk on behalf of all the people out there however some people  think Therapy is like a magic pill, you take it and you are fine. Well, its not. It will give you tools and ways to self-introspect but you have to do the tough work consistently. you have to look within yourself for why are you the way you are or what was your contribution in the past decision you have been making etc.

You have to dig into your subconscious mind and its not an easy task. It needs courage to look past your own mistakes & how you contributed to your own suffering, what were your triggers etc.  And then accordingly change the patterns consciously. We as human find it easy to blame others , we also have to take accountability as in what part did we do to suffer so much. 

And sometimes when you have no fault, still you gotta do the work. You might not be the reason for the hurt and pain but healing is your responsibility. You need to heal for yourself. 

So yes Therapy helps , only if you also put in the work consistently. Also, there are many kinds of therapy so not sure if its same for everyone out there. (score: 1) | Therapy works, I feel it is a waste of money though. A lot of the questions they ask you can just ask yourself. There are tons of resources online and books for meditation, psychology, CBD techniques, etc. (score: 1) | Yea i've tried it, its alright.. In person i found it to be pretty good because you felt like you were really chatting.. Once i had to do like virtual sessions, shit sucked.. Idk lacks the human connection.. I feel like ive found online a great and free place to chat w like minded people going through something. What are you doing now and is it helping? Doesn't hurt to give therapy a shot though (score: 1) | Nope. They told me to go to church, and find god, and get involved in church activities. I‚Äôll never see a therapist again. (score: 1) | Yes and it helped.  You need to understand that you‚Äôre doing the work in therapy sessions, the therapist is more of a guide than anything. (score: 1) | I'm working on it right now. I had one session last month, and my next session is tomorrow. I feel a little better so far, but I have 35 years of baggage. It's going to take some time to sort through it. (score: 1) | Lots of experience in this area. Three big things that help predict a positive outcome. 1) your readiness, some people aren‚Äôt ready to do the work yet, and so things won‚Äôt change. 2) the relationship with the therapist, if you don‚Äôt trust and respect them and feel like they respect you, your missing most of the benefit. 3) the therapists skill set, you want to find someone with experience with what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you feel ready for the hard work, and can find the right person, it can make a huge difference. (score: 1) | It depends on a couple of things. It's one of those things that you get out of it what you put in to it. So if you're not really committed to it and you're not thinking about it outside of your sessions and working on the things you're learning outside of your sessions, it's probably not going to help. It also depends a lot on how you mesh with your therapist. Don't be afraid to jump around until you find one you really click with. I was so skeptical at first, but better help .com was an easy way for me to find someone I clicked with. No, I'm not a bot or someone paid to endorse them. I just truly had great luck finding an amazing therapist there. I tried two before the one I've been with for a couple of years now. It's super easy to switch (and normal) therapists on the website, so there's no awkwardness, and I thought that was great. 
Good luck. Therapy can be a really transformative experience. (score: 1) | In  my experience, ""a therapist"" doesn't help much, but ""THE therapist"" can do wonders. It is very much a case by case basis and it requires sinking the time and effort into finding a therapist that works best for you as there are as many types of therapists as there are types of people. It can be a MAJOR pain in the ass, but it is beneficial if you manage to find it. It SHOULD be easier.... but unfortunately at this point in time it is not, (score: 1) | I did. First therapist basically just asked me how i felt and was very invalidating. Second therapist helped me dig in and helped me incredibly. Helped me do alot of the work myself for years until finally i hit a wall again recently.

Going to see a third one, this one is trauma informed and seems to be very well versed so we'll see what happens but i'm optimistic (score: 1) | Didn‚Äôt really work for me. (score: 1) | There is always the ups and downs of this therapy. You are not guaranteed to have the best one cause they are either just after your money, ask you the same questions for 3 hours orrrr give high dosage of anti-depressants üòí But yea my experience on that then the secondly i tried it again I got lucky that someone finally can evaluate my problem without causing my anxiety/depression to try and ruin my day again, never got any anti-depressants on the 2nd one. (score: 1) | There are many different types of therapeutic practices (CBT, DBT, psychodynamic, etc) the likelihood anyone with a complex mental illness will find the one that works for them on their first try is unlikely, that‚Äôs how it was for me. Keep trying, there‚Äôs something out there for you dear reader (score: 1) | My first therapist was not great and my second therapist is a lot better and have been seeing her for almost 2 years and not only do I feel better but I've also learned coping mechanisms and it gives me the ability to talk to someone about the issues I'm going through as the person I was 2 years ago is not the person I am now, you can always DM if you want any more information (score: 1) | Yes I have tried it I had one NHS session then around 9 months with my first therapist and 4-5 months with my second. I've just started seeing a third therapist and really hope that this is beneficial. To be honest though I wasn't putting the work in to make the changes that I needed to and I think I am just starting to do that now. It's hard if you are depressed isn't it to stick to routines, avoid bad habits and stay motivated / not avoid things. But yes good luck to anyone else I'd say therapy is definitely worth a try even if it's not for everyone. My friend said he changed his life around after being depressed for many years by doing therapy online on his own as he worked better that way. (score: 1) | Therapy helped me deal with my anxiety. I feel much better than before (score: 1) | Very much so. I did hybrid EMDR and talk therapy for a bit over a year in person, took a break, and now do therapy through Talkspace via video call. 
I've pretty much processed all my trauma, and now I'm focusing on developing better habits and trying to manage my social anxiety. (score: 1) | For me some very expensive hypnotherapies (uses hypnosis to directly explore your subconsious mind) has allowed me to process one very specific moment of childhood trauma that i wasnt even aware of as it was burried deep, but overall im not really feeling better. It provided some short term relief and also some valuable insights into my psyche and my problems. I havent tried standard CBT therapy with a psychoterapist tho. Overall therapy it a valuable tool but not a quick solution. It opens you up to start exploring your subconscious mind but you still have to do a lot of inner work yourself to really fix the root of your problems. (score: 1) | Didnt work

Meds work. I no longer need therapy after meds (score: 1) | there's been times where it's been helpful and other times where it hasn't been. finding the right therapist helps, and knowing when you don't need therapy is also helpful. i found myself continuing therapy after awhile because ive always done it and it led me to feeling sad week after week because often times therapy is focused on the things that are wrong vs right. (score: 1) | Grief therapy, yes
Regular therapy, no (score: 1) | Yes. Yes. (score: 1) | Yes able to deal with past stuff that been hard to
Talk about . It‚Äôs all about finally the right therapist , sometimes you will change therapist and see if someone is a better fit for you . It has help me understand things about my life better and see why I do certain things . Also to understand others and why they may have done the things they done . It also motivates you to get back to taking care of yourself and finally ways to make it easier to do that . Yeah it‚Äôs not for everyone but I feel like maybe it the type of therapy . There are other kinds of therapy out there you can research as well. Sometimes you need a combination of different things I had meds and therapy once it helped me a lot . Meds were good because it helps me move forward but it didn‚Äôt resolve all the stuff I was holding on to and never processed . That‚Äôs really
Important (score: 1) | I have and it saved my life. Now, that's not to say it was easy and i found the perfect fit immediately and blah blah. I have gone through probably 11 therapists in my life and I've only truly liked 2 of them and found that they helped me. So you have to find a good fit for you.  
Also, the type (or modality) of therapy has to be a good fit for you too. I personally love ACT therapy, but not a lot of people do. So you have to do a little research and see what type you might like, then find a therapist who specializes in it. 

Also, medication has helped me so much. But that is hard too and you'll probably have to try several different ones before you find one that works for your body and brain.   
But it's worth it! I wouldn't be here today without it! (score: 1) | I have been in therapy for many years and it has helped immensely. Not all of my therapist were good, but I‚Äôve had more good ones than bad ones. I mainly changed therapist due to moving, changing insurance, etc., but occasionally I just had a therapist that wasn‚Äôt for me. my current therapist is great but he‚Äôs retiring due to health reasons and I once again have to find a new therapist, but I know it will be worth the hassle of finding one. (score: 1) | It worked with a psychologist I found to have a comforting energy. I did the work and yes, I got better over time. I've been better since, more stable (also thanks to meds). However, this was not my first experience of therapy - the others obviously failed. (score: 1) | I tired many kinds for many years. And none never helped me.  
Because all the professionals didn't know what was wrong with me.  
And if they did, they never expressed it to me. Nor provided any answers.

However they often opened a very big book  
which gave them recommendations for many experimental medications they tried on me.  
Also of zero help... Some with debilitating side effects.  
Worst of which almost being brain damaged and paralyzed.

What did help me is space and time away from the source of some of my problems.  
Mainly first rooted in my family i was raised with.  
The lies I was told and the lack of love an communication.

In a boarding school with a lot of land and places to roam.  
I never did get answers for my life there either.  
The answers came later in life perhaps much too late.  
Form a lot of soul searching:  
that lead me to Faith in The Only One who ever helped me  
through all this. Is The Real Jesus Christ. Now I'm in the healing process. (score: 1) | Ive been going to therapy for over a year.

I spent my twenties a depressed, alcoholic, homeless, unmedicated schizophrenic. Your late teens, early twenties are such a difficult and complicated time even without mental illness. I feel for ya. I'm tellin you, things get better. I'm in my late 30's now. Life is so much simpler in some ways. More complicated in other ways. The world's a big complicated place, but I'm so much happier now. It'll happen to you, I think. Don't give up. (score: 2) | If any of that sounded harsh, I apologize. That was not my intention, nor was it my intention to minimize your experience. But have hope, friend. Things work out (score: 2) | Dawg just take it easy, you just got outta highschool. Start eating healthy, go to a local gym workout, educate yourself, find hobbies, watch different tv shows with great plots, and just pust in the work for the things that you want. (score: 2) | Let me start by saying, you are far from alone. As of 2021, according to the CDC, the number of people in the United States (not sure where you are located) who experienced suicidal ideation was 12.3 million people. 3.5 million actually made specific plans, and 1.7 million attempted the act. When something afflicts millions, its a pretty substantial problem, and that tends to indicate this isn't something you are weird or just some odd person out because you feel this way.

Personally, I had my first experience of suicidal ideation when I was 25, not long after I had my 2nd son. At the time, I had been repeatedly cheated on and physically assaulted by my boyfriend (now long ago ex) who is also the bio father of my son and I was being treated badly, but not telling anyone out of shame. I was recovering from having a baby, had another older child to care for, my boyfriend was not working, I was paying all the bills on my own and going to school online. It was a complete impossible disaster and I fell into a depression. But at the time, I didn't know that was what was happening.

Mental health had a much bigger stigma than the one it still carries today. I became so desperate to relieve the pain, I eventually harmed myself on a few occasions. I thought I had obviously lost my mind and that I was irreparable. I was too embarrassed to tell anyone so I felt completely alone. And everyday was so hard, aside from my mental health issues, so those just made it all that much more of a struggle. It got so bad, there were times I would have sworn my life was a lost cause. I was certain there was just no hope and that life was going to be a forever unbearable struggle. I stopped eating and I dipped down to 95 lbs. (5'4"" height, Female). I saw my doctor one day and she looked at me and said, ""You are not ok. I am going to refer you to a therapist. If you don't start eating, you are going to die.""

Even though I had wished for death throughout this time, when she said those words, I instantly thought about my children. This wasn't fair to them, and regardless of my insurmountable constant pain, I could not hurt them that way. I called my mom and told her I needed to move home for awhile with the kids. I left my boyfriend and moved back in with my parents to try to heal. And I went to the therapy recommended, and that saved my life for sure. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder. It has now been 12 years and I want you to know, it is worth it to hold on for dear life, love. Over the following 6 months, I slowly awoke out of my depression and rose to a new level of life I had never experienced. For a full 9 years consecutively I had no suicidal ideation. I had some rough times, but I also had some of the absolute best times of my entire life. Times I felt so elated, I had never imagined that life could ever even be so amazing and beautiful.

A couple of years ago I had another really gripping depressive episode because of my most recent relationship coming to an end. It seems my underlying issues are tied heavily to my romantic relationships, and are triggered when I feel betrayed or treated like i am not enough. You do have hope ahead of you, you just need to pinpoint the underlying triggers to your sadness. What is the root reason you have suicidal ideation? Do you know? That is where your healing lies. And listen, no one knows for certain exactly what happens after death, right? I mean we can believe and have faith or not, but ultimately none of us truly know. How do you know it won't be 100x worse than what you are experiencing here? What if you have to live out the painful parts you didn't press on through in some perpetual loop for many many years? What if you get stuck somewhere because you weren't supposed to go yet? That's a huge risk! I think you have many more options if you stick around.  I want you to know that as long as you resist taking that final step, you **will** see brighter days. And they are undeniably worth it. You are undeniably worth it. You owe it to your future self. This is not the final act. Please hold on.

P.S. I want you to know the people around you do care, but i have learned that the people who haven't experienced this literally just cannot conceptualize it. They cannot wrap their brains around it to really imagine that could happen. That's why anytime someone dies what do all the people who knew them and loved them say? They say, ""Why didn't I listen when he told me he needed help."" or ""Why didn't I just recognize when he was so sad, I wish i would have (insert whatever)"" They always say this. Its because people have this thing of thinking something couldnt really happen to them. we all do it. Please don't take it personally and just know your family does love you and would be devastated and irreparably broken if you left that way.

760,1dd0rhy,Looking for specific advice on triggers and intrusive thoughts,"Hello,

I've written here a few times but never really received a reply to anything, but I'd like to give this one more go.

I have, for three straight months now, been experiencing trauma symptoms. I believe this was triggered by a procedure called a flexible cystoscopy, which to summarize is a camera being fed up the urethra in order to check the bladder. I was both humiliated (I didn't want the tech nor the assistant there but I felt compelled to try to grin and bear it anyway) and the doctor actually injured me during the procedure in such a way that took months to heal.

It's getting better on its own now, but I spent the better part of three months unable to sleep properly, eat properly, or do much of anything without experiencing flashbacks. I had pain in my bladder and prostate that constantly reminded me and I have felt nauseous to the point of frequently vomiting and I couldn't ever feel clean, no matter how many times I washed I felt like my skin was crawling.

I have been looking for a therapist, or hell, even a hotline to call about this. My life is otherwise going great for the first time in decades, but if I can't get through this I genuinely don't know what's going to happen. I just took a long weekend but I need to go back to work on Wednesday, and right now I would rather just not wake up at all.

Anyone with any specific advice on dealing with this sort of thing, it would be greatly appreciated.",1,2,new,"**Hello u/!**

The reason I hold myself to that standard is that I don't have any likable qualities. I wouldn't say I'm a bad person or smth I just have nothing interesting to offer in a friendship, coupled with some negative qualities, too, which shows with most of my friends outright saying that they're friends with me due to a lack of better, interesting options.

This shows further when I realise that I'm moaning on a Reddit post on a sub where people actually have a reason to feel bad where as my issue is that I'm ungrateful for what I have... anyways:

I'm just a 'safe' option which I hate. I can't have the deeper friendships that I long for cuz I'm not good enough to have that luxury. It's unfair but It is what It is I guess.

762,1dd0ebv,"What do i have to do to hold a job , when i have all these issues with my mental health?","Okay, so its been 6 years since i started to develop mental health problems (i think, im not sure if i had them since i was a child and didnt acknowledge them), due to mental, physical and sexual abuse i got from my family, friends and people around me. I developed depression, c-ptsd, anxiety and OCD, which affected my self esteem and confidence. Right now my family dont give a fuck about me because i cant provide them money bcs of my issues (my dad passed away and im the eldest son in the family) and i dont have any friends at all. Because of those issues, i started using drugs (im done using now thankfully) .Luckily for me, there is still one good thing going on about my life which is my girlfriend ( although she was one of the main reasons of me having mental issues in the first place, its complicated, ill explain if you guys are interested in knowing why) She has been supporting me financially in the last 3 years, after my family kicked me out of the house. But because of this, i feel like im a worthless, waste of oxygen, even more than before. Ive thought of ending my life a few times. If it wasn't because of her and my faith, i wouldve been gone a long time ago. The most ive worked and stayed on a job is three months, and ive always ran away, bailed out, quit, ditched the job, whatever you wanna call it, in the end. I also tried to ditch and leave my girlfriend a few times, because i love her so much and i feel like she deserves way better than a worthless piece of shit like me, but she always stayed no matter what i do. She also offered me to go to therapy, but there is no way i would agree to burdens her even more than i already did and still doing to this day, plus her income is only enough for her commitments and needs/wants, and therapy costs SO MUCH in this country, since mental health awareness is basically non existent among people here (if you have one, 90% of them would just quickly assume youre abusing drugs). I just want to hold a job, so that one day i could pay her back, but i just cant seem to find a motivation to hold onto or when i do, it just doesnt seem worth it. When i do hold to that momentarily, there will always be, ALWAYS BE something that will prevent me from holding a job , for example, like toxic work environment (this is the most common thing that happenend to me on the job, bcs of mental health awareness issue i was talking about), or even my mental illness, where they just made me lost the will to do anything at all. I have been jumping in between 20+ jobs now. Do any of you guys are going through the same thing ? What do i do? Please help me before i think about ending my life again.  ",1,2,new,"**Hello u/!**

775,1dcxhvg,Is it wrong that I'm hurt that my mom wants another baby now that I'm almost an adult?,"For the past two years my parents (mom and step-dad) have been trying for a baby endlessly. My mom has expressed how much she would love another child, but due to older age, health issues, and immense stress, she has miscarried multiple times. It has destroyed her mentally, her last miscarriage was around the beginning of last year, and despite the constant devastation of not being able to carry another child, she continues trying. 

She has alluded a couple times that having this new baby would allow her to start over as a mother. She wasn't the greatest mom to me when I was young, and to this day she still isn't the best. I won't get into it, other than that I will never have a healthy normal attachment to any person for the rest of my life. She is aware of this.

I feel like if she truly has this baby, that when I finally leave the house and start my own life, that baby will be my replacement. *That* will be her clean slate. She believes she's too far gone with the shit she did to me, and there's absolutely no way to fix things between us. Instead of, you know, being better, but whatever. She doesn't want another child to fill their world with love and light and create a wonderful person, she wants the confirmation that she's not a bad mom by raising someone else and making them better than me.

It hurts, that she would rather put herself through the pain and devastation of miscarrying one after the other, destroy herself mentally and emotionally, for the miniscule chance of having a new baby, than truly fix things with me. She would rather endlessly face the fact that her God refuses to grant her the gift of giving life, than face me. 

Am I selfish? I don't know what to do. I can't tell her any of this, it'll just make things worse. What do I do?",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dcxhvg/is_it_wrong_that_im_hurt_that_my_mom_wants/

I‚Äôve noticed that when I recall something embarrassing I did or said I‚Äôll suddenly just bite down on my hand without really thinking. Either that or I‚Äôll yank at my hair. When I'm in public it‚Äôs easier to stop, I‚Äôll just dig my nails into my palms in instead. 

I‚Äôve never really hurt myself. It‚Äôs only ever enough to cause some short-lived pain. However, I am a little worried that someday I‚Äôll break the skin.

I had a friend who would hurt themselves too, never really understood the thought until he told me that I self harmed whenever I pulled the skin from my lips until they bled.

Start small and tackle one thing at a time. Take a painkiller first and put an icepack on your head.

I listen to all kinds of music typically. However, when I'm really, really low, I try to listen to incredibly heavy metal or classical symphony orchestral music. Two edges of a musical spectrum, I know. But either one disrupts my line of thinking and places it on the music. I listen to the technicality of it, try to isolate individual instruments, listen for the harmony, and the rhythm. If I listen to music as usual, it just pisses me off more. Listening to something abstract (to me) is what clicks me over into at least a *better mood.* I have quite a bit wrong with me, including BPD and bipolar and more. It's really hard for me to be in an up mood. But I still try. 

I am also trying to learn how to fly remote control drones. That takes my mind off things that are bothering me and typically perks me up a bit. Plus it really makes my mind work on something. I mean really concentrate. So, I like it. Despite the crashes. And I suck at flying them. But I keep trying. 

You have to find what works for you. I will tell you, a sudden jolt to your immediate environment will do it. It's usually an abrupt change that sets me off, so I use an equally sudden change to set things on. If it's controlled correctly, you'll benefit from the activity personally and emotionally.

To me that's pretty impressive, as i'm a slow reader and have some troubles finishing books.

Personally it doesn't matter to me that the media i'm consuming is happy or light, as long as i'm interested and distracted i'm good. But do be careful, eventually you must come back to reality and deal with your emotional turmoil, there is a reason escapism is considered ""bad"", you can get lost in it.

When I visit my hometown, I go to a children's petting zoo.  There are peacocks and other birds, pigs, llamas, minature pigs, sheep, ponies and plenty of minature goats.

The sea air is also great for working up a hunger which I'll use to my advantage as when I'm particularly heavy/fatigued/deeply down in myself I have little to no appetite but the salt in the ocean breeze takes care of that *very quickly*.

I eat my favorite meals. I blare music and dance around. I meditate. I do a ton of things! (score: 1) | Firstly, I try and remove my myself completely from places, people, social media apps that are cause the problem to worsen. You don't want an irritating  WhatsApp group annoying you at 7 am when you are already feeling not good. So without sending apology, just disconnect. For example, I disconnected my messenger account and stopped all human's from connecting with me on that app.

I walked out of places in the town (way back in 2018) that were causing me problems and have not considered back to any of these kinda groups before, not even in my own county. I have even reduced the stress of my laptop too, I have reduced the number of social apps I have (Discord) Re-organised my space so I can straight to what I have 2 do.

I also set rules for my brain that I stick to every day, they more like OCD rules and these allow me to have control over my life, for example deleting social media off my phone has stopped doom scrolling. TikTok is also going to shortly too. I also set limits and times when I can watch vs when I don't, for example any  tv in the day and until the late evening is off bounds. I cancelled my Freeview on my telly in my games room for this purpose.

I have make sure that I walk a lot during the day at a quite high quantity and visit the gym as well.and that is regular habit. I also have food rules too, for example I don't eat refined sugar (cakes sweets) at all or in tiny quantities. a protein bar with 1.4 grams is enough for me. I make equivalents of these items. just using fruit instead. I don't want a spoonful of contaminated poison.

If do have ""snack"" I have straight with meal, not 1.5 hour later or 3 hours, it would simple end up the trash or left for another day.. ""Suddenly I would all phobic about it"" I also don't have bread in my and no interest ever eating that again . Unless it's like Christmas, birthday 20 years from now.

I also choose personally when I can eat food vs when I don't eat every mouthful between 7pm-4pm that's that is my non eating window. Plus I have changed what eat as well, so I don't takeaways (very rarely, every few months) I eat mostly protein (of any description as it's all the same mango nutrition.

Finally things aside (these are just suggestions)  find things in life that help you feel better with the depression, okay so curl up on sofa with your comfy your evening only programme (something you have 2 think about) have fallout tv series binge, think comfy clothes a few nice light bits of dried fruit, a cup of coffee /Diet Coke, think of ways you can make you home inviting for yourself and more depression friendly.  
 If you got hobbies like gaming, listening to music do these too, but when you are not feeling great don't try hobbies that take up room and time (some people like to paint war hammer, but save this for when you are feeling motivated.  If you go YouTube at the moment, just google ""Digital drugs"" and turn off those notifications. Who gives two shits right! You don't want annoying friend, or person disturbing you whilst you are idosing. It totally harmless. the harm it's going  to cause is that moment you wake up and you have 5% battery life on your mobile. (score: 1) | Surround myself with the things I love (crochet, music, games), reward every achievement even the small victories, I also tend to avoid my phone cause it just ends up making me feel worse. If it's really bad, I will binge a show to distract myself, or watch a comfort movie like studio ghibli movies. Usually I will also get myself some herbal tea, like chamomile or redbush, and some comfort food too. I find all of this helps to lift my spirits. (score: 1) | Think about a time when you felt most alive and in love with life. What were you wearing? What activities did you do? Who did you spend time with? Make a list of all of those things and they can be your antidotes for times you feel down. 
I always say I‚Äôm depressed I‚Äôd rather be depressed watching a sunset than sitting at home staring at a wall. (score: 1) | Just star gaze. (score: 1) | Idk I usually can just kind of stop, like sometimes I‚Äôll cry it out but if there is nothing I can do about whats making me sad I can just kinda idk suck it up. Sometimes I‚Äôll get this lingering uncomfortable mood and then I‚Äôll try going for a walk, eating some good food, paint my nails, self care etc. (score: 1) | Hiking. Washing dishes (seriously!). (score: 1) | I climb. I'm not making a joke when I say that I ""climb"" I go to the rock climbing gym, or sometimes the local quarries, throw on some music, and I literally lift myself up. It's exercise that's fun, and mostly natural, save for the two, or three energy drinks that I'll consume on days like that. (score: 1) | I try to be mindful of my breathing and how it feels to inhale through my nose, and out through the mouth. Sometimes it is helpful to count your breaths! Practicing intentional breathing is also a great distraction. (score: 1) | Work out, take a walk, or spend time with friends and brothers (score: 1) | Walks, hikes, resistance training, cooking tasty food, making fun plans for the future, getting on top of daily tasks chores etc, talking to friends (although I need to do more of this admittedly), and distraction stuff like TV/Games but I have a bad streak of using this too much which leads to more depressive feelings! (score: 1) | I have a journal that I write in, everyday before expressing my thoughts. I write down two things I love about myself. Overtime I can reflect off of my past entries as a reminder of my progress or if I need to have reassurance. I also have the ‚ÄúI am - self affirmation‚Äù app that you set up motivation quotes to be sent to you. (score: 1) | Music does it for me (score: 1) | Usually I use my arms or stomach/back muscles.

I play video games (score: 1) | Going outside helps or simply opening the blinds to let some natural light in.

782,1dcwp2x,"Have you ever had the urge to bite someone, smack someone, or hit someone after constant shitty behavior?","I live an... interesting life. It's not awful by any means, but I feel as if I am being constantly prodded, provoked, and bothered. Not all of it is purposeful, some of it is just odd behavior by people. For example, one thing that has recently highly annoyed me is going through a bad time, and then listening to a relative who was there with me recount that experience via a phone call ... very loudly. The loudness isn't the issue. The issue is that the situation completely changed in the context of a phone call with someone else. Said relative LIED about half the things that happened, and revealed new information to the person on the phone that was not disclosed to me.

I don't know why, but I have the urge to bite them over the lies. An urge I know I cannot act on, but like god damn, all the strange behavior has me under extreme tension. I have no idea if that is how humans act, and I am unjustly freaking out... or if that is bizzare and not normal human behavior... and I am rightly uncomfortable and stressed.

I can describe my anger as the following: I find my jaw clamping down very strongly, and I tense all my muscles and fists. I then have a fake mental fight with said person where I take a big ol' chomp out of their arm out of principle. Then after my fake mental fight, I kind of feel justified and start to settle down. Kind of imagining giving someone an ass-kicking is my go-to relief lately. Kind of like those fake shower arguements some people have with themselves.

The issue is that I feel pushed just a *tiny* bit farther every time (when having a legitimate confrontation with the person), and I don't wanna snap. Everyone has that point where they go ""that does it"" and they do something unimaginable wacky. Whether that be walking away and never coming back, going crazy, or getting out the cast-iron frying pan and dishing out an ""abusive father level ass kicking"".

I feel like for me, my current solution is suppressing all the bad feelings, smiling and waving for one or two more years, and then finally being set up for the permanent leave when I can finally go and be around people I want to be around.

I feel like my own anger isn't recognized, and is viewed as funny, childish, or illegitimate. Whenever I'm mad, apparently my own anger isn't legitimate because the person I am mad at ""is the one who should be angry"".",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dcwp2x/have_you_ever_had_the_urge_to_bite_someone_smack/

790,1dcvvq4,TW harassment idk what to do ,"I dont know what to do. should i report this 

Hi, I usually dont post here, but I do not know what to do. I was applying for a job that I was in the hiring process for, and they polygraphed me because it was required for the job. I have been polygraphed before and passed it, but that time, it was with a woman. This time, it was with a man. We were in a closed room so I already felt uncomfortable. He did not ask for consent to put the chest strap on me which was right on top of my breasts I was wearing a turtle neck so idk I have a bigger chest size so he got upclose and personal and it made me really uncomfortable because he was around my chest area. He he kept staring at my chest when questioning me about my sex life. He made a comment like, ""When I was your age and single, I had so much time for things that I can't do now that I am married,"" after I was talking about a sexual experience. The thing that made me feel discussed with myself was when he made me talk about a sexual experience I had when I was a kid. I said, licking me, and then he said licking where and stared into my eyes and said your vagina. This was a very traumatic time in my childhood when I was assaulted. This had no relevance to the polygraph, and it made me feel bad about myself. He told me I lied about being involved in a significant crime, and I almost burst into tears and said I was sexually assaulted, so yes, technically, I was involved. He asked so many questions going into specifics with me and also was sitting really close to me. I have been dissociating all week from this, and I do not know what to do. He failed me on the polygraph.

792,1dcvb1a,Enabling vs helping,"Cw!:Executive dysfunction, depression, anxiety

Hello, I am a person with audhd, depression, anxiety and I have a partner who suffered from the same things for sure but unfortunately not diagnosed. He just has the same brain as me but since I take meds I'm able to function just a tiny bit better... 

I was wondering how I could support him while he's facing executive dysfunction with enabling him to get used to not doing stuff or ending up with bad consequences? 

He has extremely bad executive dysfunction and cannot work or really do much because he is in a state of mental paralysis. But he really wants to work it's just really painful to the point of breakdowns everyday. 

I want him to be able to reach out or help and work but I'm not sure how to encourage him to a more healthy lifestyle (when I'm also pretty unhealthy..) I want to be there for him but at the same time I'm afraid I'm causing him to feel like there aren't negative consequences (even though he definitely knows and reminds himself every second)... 

Any suggestions etc would be appreciated! 

Note: it's hard for him to reach out for professional help and also kinda impossible to be diagnosed because many stuff related to adhd are banned from his country...

I'm really struggling right now and I need help. I'm trying to get control of my mind, but I don't know what to do. I'm currently experiencing a very severe episode of OCD, and it's affecting me every single waking second. I constantly make specific predictions about things happening, and if they do happen, I take it as a sign. It's driving me crazy and I don't feel safe anywhere.

For example, when I was at the mall, I kept thinking, ""If I walk by this store and this happens, if my phone rings now, if my phone randomly shuts off, if this store has a light flicker,"" and so on. I can't be anywhere without worrying that something specific will happen, and when it does, it just reinforces my fears.

Every second, I'm making dozens of predictions and I can't focus on anything.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. How do I stop this? I'm freaking out and need some advice or support.

799,1dctb1b,"my friends betrayed me, again ","
So about 3-4 months ago my boyfriend broke up with me and it broke me compleatly, I became suicidal and my addiction to self harm returned. For the first month I was texting with a few of my friends about what's happening and how I'm doing and then on my last phone call with my ex he told me that he's getting information from my friends about what I say about him. That was the second time that I was ready to commit suicide after the break up. I felt betrayed beyond belief. It's been like two months from this situation and clearly all the people around me were done with the topic of my ex so I found shtwt where I was just posting my thoughts and it helped me, because even if I didn't get any feedback I was able to put it into the world without knowing that I'm making people that I care about feel bad. And yesterday I posted on shtwt that I was feeling suicidal, but when I got it out of my chest I deleted it and went to sleep so I wouldn't do anything stupid. My sister woke me up and our mom told us that someone called the police, I thought it was my friend because I deleted messages about my other friend working with my ex and she knew that it made me feel horrible. Turned out that it was also for that reason, but the biggest reason was because they saw what I posted on shtwt and sent it to the police. The police forced me to go to the hospital even tho I refused and so did my mom, there the doctor said that she doesn't see a reason for  hospitalization and also said what I said to the police, that the hospital won't help me. so I went home and had a pretty heated conversation with my friend and she reveled that she and that other friend were basically stalking me on twt and that they used it to control how I was feeling. I tweeted many times that I'm suicidal and none of them texted me once about it. I feel like they're treating me like a number that can't dissappear because they'll feel bad and that they just forgot that I'm human and that I'm hurting.

I just dropped out of an engineer school after 2 years in after failing the 3rd semester out of 10.

Both my parents are wealthy and working as doctors.

I wasted a lot of their money in my studies (16 000 ‚Ç¨)<---(And now I feel like a clown and guilty :-| ).

I never worked (neither in school nor for money) because I never needed to and I failed to learn to work/learn in less than 2 years.

I feel like a disappointment to my family, and I feel like it's rightfully so.

I have no experience, no diploma in a country where diplomas are the basis of all jobs.

I got kicked out by my mom "" for both of our well being"" and I live at my father's home

And i am getting pressured to work by my father ... Or ill get kicked out eventually

I isolated myself to an extreme degree, due to feeling bad and not wanting for anyone to worry.

I forgot how to socialise and can't handle shame/awkwardness, not even in movies (I flee).

I feel like all tasks are hard, each more than the other even showering is bothersome, i always feel like sleeping.

Even though I was educated to see the half full cup i only see the half empty one.

I hate myself, I fear myself.

I am scared of everything and everyone. And I walled myself in that.

I feel like I am drowning in anxiety and in doubt

I feel dull about everything ... nothing feels significant ...

I had a relapse of mental breakdown last Saturday ... Somehow I abandoned all hope while having it ... I wanted to let myself drift away ...

I had suicidal thoughts >!(and I devised a few plans to kill myself)!< and then i talked to a friend for 8h and he convinced me not to execute the plans and gave me help, but now I don't want to monopolise his attention or disrupt him, he is not an IRL friend and I felt and still feel lonely . (And my ""bad me"" thinks it's deserved)

Then i reached out to a help chat online which told me to talk to a doctor ...

I found the strength to talk about it to my dad and he answered with a "" I am happy you are not feeling well mentaly with how dire your situation is ! "" (talk of a mental support)

I contacted a psychologist ... i am seeing him later this week .

I feel extremely anxious and guilty of feeling all that. And I feel like i have no redeeming quality .

I don't have any more suicidal thoughs but scarily enough i don't feel fear for death ?

Everything is just empty ? Usually I am extremely sensitive and i have a hard time figuring out my emotions but i just feel EMPTY ?

WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME ?

And do i deserve support ? I don't think so but maybe you have another point of view ...

813,1dcu0vj,"Can Grief Cause a Breakup? Seeking Advice on Navigating My Relationship While Grieving
","Hey Reddit,

I‚Äôm a 21-year-old in a two-year relationship, and I could really use some advice or opinions on my situation. To give some context:

In May of last year, I lost my dad, and it's been incredibly tough. My girlfriend has been there for me through everything, and I genuinely don't know where I'd be without her support. However, we have some compatibility issues that seem to be getting worse. She has an anxious attachment style and needs a lot of closeness and reassurance, while I have an avoidant attachment style and tend to pull away, especially when I'm overwhelmed or need time alone. This dynamic has caused friction between us in the past.

About a month ago, things came to a head, and we decided to take a two-week no-contact break because our issues were becoming too much to handle. During that time, I tried to focus on grieving, spending time with friends and family, and engaging in hobbies to distract myself.

When we reconnected after the break, we both expressed our desire to make things work and reaffirmed our love for each other. I was honest with her that even though it's been over a year since my dad passed, I‚Äôm still not in the right emotional headspace. I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to give as much effort to our relationship as I did before my dad died‚Äîmaybe only 20-30% compared to before‚Äîand she agreed to try to work through it together.

Now, a month later, the same issues have resurfaced. I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed again and unsure what to do. Should we consider taking more time apart for me to heal? Is there something I can do to better balance my need for space and her need for closeness? I‚Äôm struggling to meet the expectations I set for our relationship before my dad died, and I‚Äôm worried this might be affecting us more than I can manage. I also worry that us continuing this will just lead us right back here since we were just here about a month ago. I also feel like she doesnt understand me and my grief or why I might feel the way I do.

Has anyone been through something similar? Can grief really be a factor in a breakup? How did you navigate your relationship while dealing with significant loss? Any advice or insight would be appreciated.

Thanks for reading and for any help you can offer.

TL;DR: Lost my dad a year ago and still struggling emotionally. My girlfriend and I have different attachment styles, causing friction. After a two-week break, we‚Äôre trying to make it work, but the same issues are resurfacing. Seeking advice on whether to take more time apart or how to balance our needs.

815,1dctyv7,Hallucinations at night are getting worse,"I actually don't think there is anything to do about this. Maybe this is more like venting, but I feel like I need some sort of support rather than shouting out problems.

I've always suffered from seeing hallucinations at night. I only recently learned that they are called hypnopompic hallucinations, which is ironic since i first remember experiencing them in the nineties. Should have looked in to them more earlier in my life, but they come and go. Some periods are more intense, sometimes they can disappear for months at a time.

I'm not a drinker, don't take any drugs and would call myself healthy otherwise. 

A typical ""session"" is that I wake up in the middle of the night, and see insects. We're talking big bugs, the size of your palm, crawling around in the room. I can see them as clearly as day, and there is no doubt in my mind **they are not real**, but they seem real enough for me to get a elevated heartbeat and worry my wife each time it happens.

For anyone wondering what it's like waking up tired in the night, and suddenly see 10 centimeter big cockroaches crawling in your bed, I can tell you it's not that much of a walk in the park. Note that I do not have a phobia against bugs.

I've gotten used to these sessions though, but the last two weeks the hallucinations have been getting progressivly worse. It's not only creepy crawlers, it's rodents and bats. And it's not only seeing them anymore, now I can also feel them. Havn't experienced that since childhood.

Last night i was barely awake, when I saw a bat flying trough the bedroom and land on my hand. This time i felt it crawl briefly on me with it's claws before I shooed it away, and it landed by the window.

I was so convinced it was real that I got up and got a big bowl from the kitchen to catch it. Surprise, it was not there when I got back. Never was. Good luck falling asleep again.

I don't want to burden my wife with these hallucinations getting worse, she has enough to think about anyway. And I know the hallucinations are not dangerous. But they *are* starting to affect my sleep more severely than ever, which triggers them to occur even more often.

Propably just need to vent Guess the flair is wrong, but I also feel like I need a good tap on the back with a ""*It will be allright*"".

But if anyone wants to know more about a condition like this, feel free to ask.",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dctyv7/hallucinations_at_night_are_getting_worse/

817,1dco4z4,My sister hates my (depression?) room and criticizes it every visit,"To expand on my title, my room is messy yes but I work hard in cleaning it. I vacuum all the hair and dust (that accumulates very fast) once or twice every week, I change my sheets weekly and yes sometimes the plates of old dishes or cups overstay their welcome for 2 days or so, along with empty plastic bottles. My desk though is a little cluttered, with little trinkets and my school work and papers, hair ties and random daily use objects. 

When a mess occurs, I do not feel nor do I think that I have to clean it up immediately or take care of it in some way. It isn‚Äôt my priority, it does not bother me, but it bothers other people; which bothers me. I have depression, as well as frequent thoughts of suicide and I really do my best to manage and cope with them, trying to take care of myself and my appearance, maintain my relationships and even to do a daily routine. I know mental health can affect a person‚Äôs room, and I want to have a clean room, it is just a preference so I clean my room in the standard that I think is clean.

All of those things I mentioned above are very mentally tiring to do and to maintain despite being basic things in life. 

My sister doesn‚Äôt seem to understand though, I think. She‚Äôs in her mid-twenties and I am in my teens. Every time she comes over, she criticizes my room and mentions the strands of hair on the floor (I try to vacuum them everyday since my hair falls often), the papers, my cluttered desk, empty water bottles. Even if my pants that were on the floor (due to me rushing to change for dinner) had her saying ‚ÄúDisgusting.‚Äù

Some days (when I freshly clean my room and no mess has accumulated), I have no trash, no dishes, very little water bottles, a clean floor, slightly messy table but just a singular shoe box in the middle of my room and she would criticize and berate me for the shoe box. 

It hurts my feelings deeply in the moment, but later on the feeling goes away but it makes me scared to let people into my room or seeing my room.

Just a few minutes ago she told me ‚ÄúDo you know a few people have even asked me to teach you at how to clean your room? It‚Äôs embarrassing for me, you know?‚Äù and it hurt me. 

She‚Äôs aware that I have suicidal thoughts, and that I have depression. I‚Äôve opened up to her about how I even find it very hard to even do the most basic tasks, so I do not know why she says these things. Maybe I am a kid to her and seem lazy or careless, I don‚Äôt know. We are on good terms and are close, but moments like these make me feel insecure and alone.

Any thoughts or opinions? I don‚Äôt necessarily need to know who is in the wrong. Should I clean my room more deeply and care for it more? I don‚Äôt mind doing so, but it is not a priority as I think handling my emotions and thoughts comes first daily. 

I‚Äôm open for criticism also, I just want a better understanding of the situation and my sister, as well as how I should proceed.",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dco4z4/my_sister_hates_my_depression_room_and_criticizes/

so the last times something like that happened I explained my husband calmly that our friend meant no harm to him he is kind of sad and jealous that he can eat. Oh boy little did I know that my husband didn't see me as de-escalating he saw me as his enemy having an affair with our friend (which I definitely haven't and would never think about) 
Well I learnt my lesson and didn't say it this time, but it went down hill quite fast. He held a knife to his stomach and said he don't like his body and will cut it off.

\_

RN I feel like I have to fight my own brain every day to do things I end up enjoying.

Usually this just results in me doing ""lazy"" things (laying with cats, playing easy/comfy games), or in ""brain-dead"" tasks like cleaning.

But it causes problems with my job (late to work, tempted to skip). But I don't... hate my job? I love my team and I don't mind most of my tasks.

A higher dosage (triple) of my medication didn't help with this either.

\_

Other notes/thoughts from my end:

* To me, it sounds like some form of executive dysfunction.
* I don't think I match the ADHD criteria.
* I also doubt it is bipolar, because neither my moods nor their swings seem intense enough.
* Cognitive function is good (tested during psychological evaluation)
* Impulsive tendencies (want to do things I think of right away)

I can deal with forcing myself to make a call, but forcing myself to get out of bed the majority of my days is just too much.

So if anyone has any input for me, it would be greatly appreciated!

Whether you joined at 17.5 before you graduated high-school and got run over by your Basic Training Drill Sergeants while ruck marching at relaxin' Fort Jackson.

Whether you did green to gold on your first 4 year contract and did 16 years as an officer and become a chaplain and are still serving, wondering what it'll be like when you finally have to retire.

I'm not sure about the National Guard or Reserves but I know you did basic training and you did advanced training. That is where much of the trauma lies. And they are introducing more holistic and wellness practices into basic and ait, "" "" , to mitigate the extent of the mental health damage a lot of us have already before joining, which is why we joined in the first place. We didn't play nice with others and always knew we were destined for something greater.

I say all of that to sort of touch on some real life matters that bring all of us together as Veterans. We are not fighting for our benefits but for our identity. I don't identify as a proud person or a shameful person but a tough SOB and I know that being vulnerable is the toughest thing anyone can do.

When the government has 516 billion dollars in VA money why are they so afraid to use it on veterans? I'm hearing about claims taking 10 years. How about they pay us thinking we are innocent and if we end up lying we owe the money? 

I'm tired of thinking veterans are treated worse than criminals. Guilty for benefits until proven innocent. I've seen reenactments of Vietnam vets. They talk about seeing all of their friends murdered, and so they go in at night and start shooting up villages and come home and dream about being able to make amends to the daughters. But they wake up to reality.

I did 4 years but I'm a very sensitive person. My mom died when I was 6, I was in a group home, my dad died when I was 19. I was abused by my aunt.and uncle, and my group home was pretty violent. 

Mother fucker I'm so happy to have NY benefits. It's like winning the lottery. But it's been 2.75 years since I ETSd and less time since I got med boarded after that and I feel like 10 years has passed. My memory is fucked, people are afraid of me, I'm not in touch with reality. 

Whoever gets this far, I hope you have read everything and know I'm not crying. I'm connecting and saying do the right thing and use these benefits. Not for you but for the veterans of the future.

844,1dcpens,How do you fight a victim mentality?,"I've gone through a lot, that much is for sure, and I don't want to invalidate that by any of what I'm about to say.

However, nowadays I can't seem to see the positives in any situation and always feel like bad things are happening to me. There are good things, I'm not the worst off, and I can rationalize all of that, but it does *nothing* to stop how I feel, and I'm on a pretty steep downhill slope right now that's leaving me feeling very depressed and hopeless and verging on dark thoughts I've been fighting off for a long, long time. 

For example, I presently have huge housing issues, which has been a running theme for 10 years based on nothing other than bad luck, really. I'm financially OK-ish, but I've had a horrid run of awful rental environments (including one where sewage was infiltrating my basement, causing not only structural issues but also black mold and flies, all of which led to me losing hair from stress!) that just seems to keep going. I find it really hard not to look at this situation and not think I'm either being targeted, that I'm somehow deserving of it, or that there's no hope of me ever being happy. 

People keep telling me not to think that way, that it's just bad luck or a sign of the times or whatever, but it's not helping. I'm sinking further and further into this feeling that I'm basically destined to live miserably forever, and quite frankly I'm running out of energy if that's the case. I'm pretty good at keeping my head above water, having struggled with bad thoughts since a very young age, but increasingly I'm just uncontrollably tuning out whenever people offer their advice, I can't afford therapy, and running out of reasons to keep fighting.

My dissatisfaction and depression usually stem from other people‚Äôs attitudes toward me, which they will then promptly tell me that I can‚Äôt really do anything about anyway. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt change people.‚Äù Okay, but what if it‚Äôs everyone? That‚Äôs usually where the conversation stalls out and they circle back to how I need to change. Not sure what else they do but help give out scripts to keep pharma paid.

I have come to view the experience as a form of secular confession.

They have said that I need to be more accountable for my actions as ultimately I have control over it and it‚Äôs a choice. 

I feel from what you‚Äôve put is you may unconsciously be resistant to changing your own behaviour. If everyone has an ‚Äòattitude‚Äô towards you there must be something in your behaviour that you may or may not be aware of that people dislike. 

My advice would be to either figure out what you do that irks people or decide that therapy isn‚Äôt for you. Ultimately you have to put work in as well and you have to be prepared to change the elements of yourself that are damaging to your health. 

I hope you can figure out what it is you are prepared to do. If you don‚Äôt want to change anything then I think you are wasting your time and your therapists time by going to therapy. 

I apologise if some of this comes a bit harsh but I do think a lot of people self-sabotage (I definitely have) their chance of therapy being successful because they want a magic pill or quick fix to fix their depression. It is not easy and you have to do work to. (score: 1) | Thanks for the thoughtful comment. Some things are out of my control. I‚Äôm not blessed with genetics physically, I‚Äôm part of a small family of immigrants, I was alone most of my life, etc. It‚Äôs not like I can win the lottery by simply putting my mind to it. But one feedback I consistently get is that I‚Äôm so smart it‚Äôs intimidating to others. So what do I do?  Act dumb? Let people walk all over me?

It seems that what irks people the most about me is the fact that I exist. But I can‚Äôt say that because then that will make them feel bad. Because obviously their feelings matter more than mine. So I found what works best for everyone seems to be me resorting to a hermit life. Under my religious beliefs, it‚Äôs better to be honest in the name of good than lying and humoring people when they think they have it all figured out. But also they clearly have no problem telling me what I‚Äôm doing wrong, even when they don‚Äôt understand the whole context. That feels like a very subtle, normalized form of persecution.

What if I‚Äôm just fine? I‚Äôm in much better shape than the world is as a whole right now, I would say. So I have trouble understanding on what authority people feel they have to tell me these things. We know next to nothing about the mind, let alone the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to interact with others.

‚Ä¢ But the biggest problem has been with my partner since they are involved in my life. It was like a switch going off. I was repulsed by the idea of dating them, liking them. 
‚Ä¢ I cant imagine myself with anyone anymore. I can't imagine chasing after anything/any achievement in this life. Im obsessively reading stuff related to that fiction.

After about a week I go back to school, already stressing because of my exams, and get jumped by about 10 boys in the town as I'm walking towards school. Since then she has published many Tik toks naming me, saying things like I hit her, I raped her, I forced her to get rid of a child. None of this is true but the only people who believe me are adults I know ( at school and at home) because they know I'm not the type of person to do any of that, my best friend and my family. Other than that, no one has spoken to me in the last month. Not once. I'm worried everyday. My life consists of exams and coming home. I have permission to leave my exam before everyone because people have said there going to beat me. One person even threatened to cut right down my eye blinding me and leaving me a big scar. I haven't done any of the accusations but my ex keeps making my life worse and worse. There's nothing I can do but ignore it but my life is so shit now that all I do is eat and sleep. I'm on the verge of losing it and I don't know what to do anymore. 

Summary: My ex has accused me of things I've not done and no one will speak to me and it's got me beaten up and jumped twice in a month. My mental health is so bad because of it and I don't know what to do anymore. ",0,2,new,"**Hello u/!**

857,1dcntw8,Meditation works - it just takes a while ,"I've struggled with depression, anxiety and SH for a long time. Of course, therapy and medication can work really well if you get the right match. I unfortunately never found that. I've tried meditating before, but it really didn't help and made me even more anxious so I stopped. 

But recently I tried again - there's a video by HealthyGamerGG that breaks down how meditation affects you in the short and long term. It made me reconsider the practice. 

I'm just sharing my observations of my own experience. Before, I would do 10-minute guided meditations that really didn't help much. But this time, I tried going longer, roughly 20-30 minutes. I tried a couple of different types of meditation, one of them being a guided approach, the other a breathing exercise. 

By doing it longer for each session and not expecting immediate results, I found myself much more aware of my own predicaments, reducing my impulsiveness, being more comfortable with myself instead of reaching for distractions. And I'm slowly realizing things about myself that I never had the space in my mind to see before. It's definitely not useless. 

So if it's something you feel might help you, I'd suggest thinking of it like going to the gym. You won't see any immediate results, but consistency over time will help you immensely.",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dcntw8/meditation_works_it_just_takes_a_while/

My last few outbursts have gotten really bad, my anger has always been a problem since I was a kid, I had a habit of breaking my electronics for stupid reasons but I feel like it has developed into something more serious. 

With today, my reaction was really frightening after watching porn, first I started punching my shelves beside my desk, after that I moved to the bathroom to clean up where I punched the door twice, punched the door again to the bathroom door, I tried to calm myself down but failed and raced into my room, I started throwing/punching/kicking anything I could find even going as far as hitting myself.

Although it's not possible to get back what you've lost once in life. And even if you do get it...it will not last longer anyway. 

It was your fault that you made him the center of your universe and lost yourself. You should never repeat this mistake again. This is always the mistake a person makes when he/she falls in love for the first time. 

Now , there could be a chance to get him back...but for that you need to find yourself back. Focus on your life, your mental and physical health rather than focusing on your past. 

Try distancing yourself from him, cuz sometimes distance does wonder than constantly clinging with each other. Make him feel your absence. You need to act confident and be happy. That's what he wants too. He'll surely come around if he really loved you.

And even if he doesn't, you're not the first one going through this phase. Everyone has gone through this. 
The best thing about a heartbreak is that the best part of life starts after this. Many songs, philosophies, art etcetera have emerged after going through heart wrenching pain. 

But don't let this breakup take too much time in your life. I've ruined 6 years cuz of this and after this I don't regret losing the person, all I regret is losing the time. Time is essential.

868,1dcltnm,Why am I obsessing over this? ,"I have always been like this for as long as I can remember.

With my ex, he had a friends and benefits situation with a friend and he remained friends with her, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking he would rather be with her instead of me and I made it very known I had issues about it. All of his female friends eventually became an issue in my mind. The obsessive thoughts got worse after him though as he cheated on me 5 times (I know I‚Äôm dumb for staying with him). 
I am currently with a new partner of 3 years now. At the beginning of the relationship he told me all about past relationships and sexual experiences. I constantly obsess over it with occasional breaks of obsession. I‚Äôve told him about it and he‚Äôs been awesome at trying to help but there‚Äôs obviously not much he can do. As of right now, we are planning a trip to Cali and all I can think about is how he had a sexual encounter with a waitress in Florida (before we met).

869,1dclhvl,How to deal with FOMO even for things you don't necessarily WANT to do?,"So this might sound like a bit of a dumb thing to struggle with, but I've struggled with it for years and I feel like it's beginning to take over my life. Essentially, FOMO has got the better of me, to the point that I'll even talk myself into doing things I'm not really that interested in doing. 

For example, it might be something as small as going for a drink with friends after work, or something bigger like going to a music festival. The reasons for not going range from just being tired and wanting to go and collapse after work, to just having some bad experiences with attending music festivals in the past and not wanting to have to go through it again.

In my head, I know I should just say ""no, but thanks for the offer."" But I find it so difficult to accept that I might miss out on a funny moment, not be included in future plans, or that my friends might talk ill of me behind my back, that I end up caving and doing it anyway. I also argue that because I'm admittedly a bit more introverted and recharge my social battery by being on my own, making myself go out and go for drinks etc. is something I should do to push myself out of my comfort zone a little more.

It's reached the point where I've turned down going to see my partner's family for a weekend or going on holiday in fear of missing out on a single night out. 

I think there's probably some childhood trauma of bullying/ being left out playing a part here (for some reason, when I was younger I didn't get invited to some kid's pool party despite being in that friendship group). I know I've got insecurities, and I'm trying to just push through the FOMO and accept that it's going to happen.

870,1dcku52,Why do I fantasize about being hospitalized?,"It's not like I want to hurt myself but I want to get hurt and be hospitalized from it. I fantasize about being badly injured or being in a coma, friends and family visiting and being worried about me. 

Recently someone close to me had a medical procedure and had to recover for about a week. Since they're close to me and I had to help take care of them, I saw that they were well taken care of by their family. I guess that's where it started and I got jealous of them which honestly scares me.

As a kid I was often praised for being healthy and rarely getting sick
but I've always had these fantasies throughout childhood and my teenage years but they were only daydreams and scenarios I used to think of to help me sleep.

Now I find myself genuinely hoping that I'd get into an accident or get diagnosed with an illness or something. I don't want to die from those but just be hospitalized. 

I've had only two hospital visits in my life: once when I injured a leg from sports and the other from a seizure/possible OD. I remember feeling fairly embarrassed about the second visit especially but now even though I won't try OD on purpose, I find myself wanting to be sent to the hospital again and staying for a long time.

Funnily enough, for the past year my health hasn't been the best and I get sick easily because of stress and being busy. I'm actually coming down with a bad cold as I write this and I feel messed up for being hopeful that it might possibly get worse. I hate the feeling of getting sick or being injured but I want to experience it. I know people care about me and would worry.

880,1dck1nz,How would you explain religion to your child in a non-bias way?,"So, I'm christian, and I'm in a serious relationship with an atheist. He is my everything, I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Recently I've been worried about how we would explain religion to our children.

I would like to wait until they ask, and then give them a brief explanation of what the concept of God is, and that some people believe that's the way the world was created, and some people believe in different gods, and some people believe in none. I'd like to tell them that it's up to them to think about it, learn about it if they'd like, and decide what they believe themselves. 

I'm generally very private with my religious beliefs, because I view it more as a personal relationship with God. It's a very private thing for me, so I don't speak about it much. 

I just don't know if this is the right call. I know my boyfriend would be much happier just telling them it's a myth and to not put anymore thought into it because it's pointless. I don't want to push my children into religion at all, because I think it's such a serious topic that it's better to wait until they discover it on their own. And I definitely don't want to raise a human being looking to religion to be their conscience for them. They need to learn how to be a decent person without an all-seeing being looking over their shoulder to make sure of it.",7,12,new,"you already explained it pretty well but I would stray from the ""god created the world"" bit, as school will likely teach them about big bang and evolution and it might be confusing to hear 2 different things.

Ultimately they'll eventually decide what they want to follow (score: 2) | I'd explain faith more than religion.

I was bought up Christian. Still am. My ex was science all the way. We kept religion out of our conversations, only thing was I went to church and bible studies. I never pushed it on him/anyone. Answered any questions they had.

I've been baptised but it wasn't until I was old enough to make my own decision (I was in my 20s) (score: 2) | Religion is just as important as any other topic as it has formed a lot of people's beliefs, the way the world has developed, and even offers a way to focus on something that is not part of our immediate reality. No matter the sect, God, or belief system, it holds a lot of importance and relevance and should be treated as a way to further connect with people from different backgrounds rather than further divide us. (score: 1) | I think you‚Äôre on the right track. My parents were raised Catholic, my dad more strict. I was baptized‚Ä¶ but never made to go to church. (My dad stopped going as well, mainly due to his work schedule.) I was told what my dad believed. But, my mom told me I could find my own path when it came to religion. I‚Äôm really grateful for that. Just wanted to chime in with that. Tell your kids what you believe, what your partner believes‚Ä¶ but make sure they know they can figure out what they believe on their own over time. There‚Äôs no right or wrong way. If you‚Äôre interested‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm mostly agnostic‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt doubt there is something more sometimes. I just don‚Äôt know what, and I‚Äôm okay with that. I‚Äôm spiritual. I don‚Äôt feel the need to go to church, it‚Äôs just not for me, spirituality is more of an individual thing for me. (score: 1) | I think it's fair to explain you believe in it, your partner doesnt, and it's up to the child to ultimately decide once they're ready. And that they can change it at any point. DON'T use fear tactics like ""you'll burn for eternity if you don't believe"" as that is manufactured consent via fear mongering.

But if they take interest in it, you have to explore with them all the other religions, what they believe, why their deities are ones you don't believe in, and why your husband doesn't believe any of it. This would be over years. If you only explain it in a christian/non-christian way it's still biased. So check into community centers like mosques or temples when they're ready to have somebody who knows about it explain it to them.

This playlist is a good place to start but shouldn't be the only thing they learn: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlvEymU-S4o&list=PLPXQWpXEHYlcBYxBUfD98ixQh7iKJuHEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlvEymU-S4o&list=PLPXQWpXEHYlcBYxBUfD98ixQh7iKJuHEs) .  When the time comes, watch them together and learn something yourself. This is incredibly important to be aware of what the religions actually are so you're not passively islamaphobic (for example) simply due to ignorance.

This is coming from somebody that was heavily indoctrinated into Christianity who doesn't believe in it anymore. (We were ""real"" Christians who were the good ones who followed the rules.) When I was agnostic in my early twenties, I liked daoism but decided it wasn't for me.

Also, it's very important to explore with them the relation to colonialism that religion has had in the world. Not all religious people are inquisitors, but the conversation about your belief validating harm to others is an important one. And to question why a god would want it's people to do that to other people. It's easy to say ""oh they just used it as an excuse"", but the effects of this are all over the world and will shed some light on indigenous human rights struggles. That may affect their decision because I know it did mine. (If ""God loves America"", why the genocide on natives to make room to build the country off slave labor?)

Lastly I'd explore the topic of faith vs religion. Faith is trusting things will work out, religion is the form it takes (or doesnt take). Blind faith in a religion is when things can go off the rails. You need faith to have religion, but you dont need religion to have faith. (score: 1) | I would start out by talking about how there are hundreds of different religions and no right or wrong answers when it comes to spirituality (or lack thereof). 

Maybe something like this: 

‚ÄúEveryone has different beliefs when it comes to ‚Äúbig questions‚Äù that we can‚Äôt really know the answers to, and it is okay to have different beliefs. For example, what do you think happens when we die? Some people believe nothing happens and it‚Äôs like sleeping forever, some people believe that you have a soul that comes back to earth in a different way, some people believe we are judged based on our actions and sent to heaven/hell/purgatory, [insert other beliefs here], but I believe ______ and daddy believes ______.

I would say it's more important to teach them morals and that sort of thing rather than anything about a specific deity/deities. Having an open mind about religion is important and will help your kids further down the line. And, this may seem obvious, but I would recommend staying away from religious schools. Being around a diverse group of people will be beneficial IMHO. (score: 1) | I‚Äôm not gonna state my faith but my parents taught me everything about their beliefs till I was a teenager.

I imagine the demons that attack me in one of their next incarnations, when they've achieved apotheosis and have connected to an unlimited supply of free will, when they've become their own take on God. This is my usual advice.

Healing yourself by keeping cool is the faster way to heal yourself. Keeping cool is about  faking it until you make it, at first.

(score: 2) | Hearing voices is mild. In my experience. A little meditation can actually quell those noises. Watching your triggers. First thing in the morning, you usually feel fine, then attacks occur from trigger points in the environment. Simply noticing those attacks and taking appropriate action is usually enough. Green tea, a step outside. 

What really drove me crazy was there not being enough up to date spirituality/methods of being in good spirits that align with our individuality; I mean we're all Atheist types, right.. Reddit in general, I mean, so we automatically won't turn to Jesus and science will often simply medicate you and hopefully turn you around in therapy, which is nice... but it doesn't explain a lot of stuff.

Having spiritual practices will crush voices. We're just not really as well connected to these mind-over matters lifestyles, like with Hinduism and Buddhism, even African spirituality, which are highly prevalent within their cultures. The most direct translation we have is with Christianity, but it's philosophy disregarded the original emotionally calming ways, like Wicca or even further back, native American spirituality. We need stronger spiritual backbone because otherwise we succumb to a sort of cabin fever that the west created from migrating to Europe and the Americas, which definitely required suitable housing. We're very private in the west. In Africa, for instance, kids are always outside because it's warm.

I like the idea that there were others alive like Jesus at the time who would be more like the traditional westerner that is private, like a hermit. They would focus on it because they were just too unique, which drew downvotes of the time. Who wants to be around that? People who beam and people whose beam is uncovered by interacting with others, which in the west is taken inside the hermit/cabin fever paradigm. You can so easily overcome these attacking entities. I like to think we're all evolving to the point of becoming our own version of God, like it's at the peak of our wave function, and we're in superposition with it or the dirt... which is going to win? You with unlimited power or dirt? Tune into it. Better yet, tune into it with others who are your oppressors.

Quantum mechanics even allows for retrocausality. I prefer to not observe quanta, presently, which has open me up to myself and through this I've had paradoxes occur, the future changing the present. Tune in to [you.fm](http://you.fm) by not observing a photon, for instance. The photon is then a wave, you can can delayed choice quantum on when to observe it. You can leave the future to collapse the present; chaos theory, magic and quantum mechanics will lead you to shamanism. The tribe became human when they realized the divine through psychoactive substance use. I think I saw Hera on DMT. She was a Goddess. A giant blue elf inside an divine-organic machine. She said, ""Come to me.""

Something is amazing is going on, and I think those with mental illness will be at the heart of a theory of everything. I've definitely started to connect with that in me. I'm not urging OP to practice this, but this is the place from which I come. Anger is heat, chilling out is cool. See the interloper demons in their highest state, perhaps in their next life and channel them.

Hate is powerful and an infection of love, like sick gravity... the law of repulsion. It really can program us as children to want to self destruct when we're older. Society isn't doing anything about it, so it falls to people like us to put together ourselves over and over, revealing more and more of the mind. Edifices and ore veins within the psyche that stand the test of erosion can teach us. Until then, we're a neurotic species.

890,1dcels2,A guy I was talking to threatened to off himself if I don't stay ,"Hello, 

I just want to vent because this happened today. I was talking to someone for about a month or so. This has only been online and through another app. Anyways, everything was going well but as time goes by, it's clear that we both want different things in a relationship and we view some things differently. I explained to him what I was feeling in regard to some of our differences. I told him that I do not think it's a good idea for us to continue our relationship but I will happily be his friend and still keep in touch. That's when he started to threaten me that he was going to ""play with his gun"" because there's nothing else to live for without me. It continued on for about a week or so and I kept telling him that I DO NOT want him to hurt himself. I kept reassuring him that his life is important and that I'm still going to be around but just not as a girlfriend. Unfortunately, I do not have any of his friends or family contact information. Hell, I don't even know his last name. That's how early we were in the talking phase. I couldn't even warn anyone. 

We didn't talk for about 2 days and today he saw me online with a few friends. He started to harass me, cuss me out, and call me names. He told me that I wanted to stop talking to him because I probably wanted to ""suck dicks"" and ""shake my ass"". I told him that his behavior is really unacceptable at this point and I wished him the best. He started to threaten me again with suicide. However, this time, I ended up blocking him on everything. 

I'm just venting. I don't know if I did the right thing. 

Update: I caved in and checked the game we met in. He was online about 20 minutes ago and he even gifted me the currency we use in the game. I'm so confused right now. Do I keep him blocked on everything? ",1,0,new,,

893,1dcd407,The disturbing childhood and my behaviors as a child.,"Hello. This is going to be deleted later as I don't want this traceable with me, but I would like some advice and thoughts. As an 18 currently I have many mental issues like severe anxiety and depression, anxious-attachment and lots of self harm and suicidal thoughts. I struggle with empathy outside of close friends and I have not as much for family as I should. I feel very particular about things and am also very paranoid. But that's not what I want to talk about. When I was 3-6 I used to hurt my pets. Not very bad, I would drop rocks on my dog's heads and I would feel bad eventually and I would take puppies and drop them from a height(doesn't matter how high but not very). This all culminates and stops when I tortured my lizard and eventually boiled him alive. This next part makes me want to kill myself so fucking much so please go easy. I used to, fully clothed both of us, touch my sister in inappropriate areas and just showed her my. She was 3 and probably doesn't remember this at all I pray. I have not done anything like that since I swear. There was no naked touching and no rape but It's still so gross. I later sucked the penis of a friend after what I feel like was pressure from me however he agreed and I stopped when he said to( I was probably 12). I also grew up watching gross porn. I also found out I was gay. This feels like a serial killer's backstory and I was just thinking about my childhood and how fucked up I was and am. At this point I just want to kill myself. Life is miserable and I'm a horrible person and deserve to rid myself of this earth. Is there any thoughts anyone can add. Preferably offer some peace of mind, if not I completely understand.

894,1dcd08g,Partner considering ending her life,"I (32M, foreigner) am living in Japan with my partner (28F, japanese).

We have been living together for around 3 years but due to many circumstances i don't feel we should continue our relationship anymore. (she is also my fiancee since 2 years ago)

However, upon starting discussing this possibility, due to the fact that she was extremely invested in me and she also lost ties to her family due to our relationship, he started mentioning the serious possibility of considering suicide, as now I am also living her and she is really losing her motivation to live.

Now, I do know sometimes people threat to do this when breaking up, but I have seen people with depression in the past, and I want to believe I can sense when someone is being serious about their suicidal thoughts, which seems to be the case this time.

I want to help her avoid this, but considering its me the one who is generating this situation, is hard.

I have tried convicing her to keep her friends close and communicating with her, or even finding mental support here. However, she mentions me that the moment she decides to take the step for looking at ""official"" mental support is the same moment she would be making her mind to do the deed... She even started thinking of how she will do it and the possible timelines to do so.

I have been trying to find mental support here in Japan but is quite lacking. Most of them are chats but unless you are the actual person in distress they don't reply to you.

896,1dccqnl,Needing advice and help without religion,"Hey everyone,



I created this throwaway account because I really need some help. I've struggled with smoking pot since I was 15 and now, at 33, I'm facing even bigger challenges. The past three years have been particularly tough. I lost my best friend (he died in his sleep from heart complications) and our dog of 8 years in the same month. This sent my small friend group into a tailspin, and we all turned to some unhealthy coping mechanisms.



I‚Äôve been with my wife for 11 years, and she‚Äôs dealing with the same issues. We don‚Äôt have children or major responsibilities outside of our jobs, but our jobs are part of why we need help. We both hold community positions where we‚Äôre well recognized and liked, which is why we need to stay anonymous. No one knows how deep we‚Äôve fallen into this hole, and we feel like we‚Äôre letting each other down. We're struggling to find a way out without resorting to religious groups or long counseling trips (we live in the country).



It all started with some coke after drinking. Through friends with shady connections, we gained regular, cheap access to coke. Using coke regularly led to heavy drinking and smoking. On our recovery days, we‚Äôd smoke pot and binge eat. As a result, we‚Äôve gained weight, developed bags under our eyes, and become severely out of shape. Despite this, no one has noticed, and we continue to excel at our jobs. We also have the flexibility to work from home, which lets us indulge in these habits and take days off repeatedly.



We‚Äôve both been hurt by religion and don‚Äôt want to join recovery groups focused on God, which are the only ones available in our rural area. We don‚Äôt want to lose our friends either, as they‚Äôre our only friends and we‚Äôve known them since childhood. Our home life feels monotonous, filled with chores, games, eating, and basic tasks. The joy seems gone from our lives. Despite this, my wife and I love each other deeply and want to do better for each other. We‚Äôre struggling to find consistency while at home.



When I manage to stay off coke, I do well with not drinking or smoking. But staying away from coke is hard since it motivates me to tackle home tasks. Without it, I spiral into frustration and a messy environment, making it hard to clean up while trying to get sober. This mess triggers my coke habit, which in turn triggers alcohol and smoking.



How can I break this cycle? Any advice is much appreciated.",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dccqnl/needing_advice_and_help_without_religion/

900,1dcb4ci,Trying to figure myself out,"

Hey everybody, recently I've been a bit confused trying to navigate myself and who exactly I am and I'm just hoping to make some sense out of what I've come to realize about myself. 

A few months ago I came to the realization that my whole life up to this point has more or less been a facade. Growing up I was always kind and courteous because that's what I was told to do and I was under the impression because of this I would develop relationships with people but on that same token I always felt disconnected and as a result was in and out of institutions because I felt I shouldn't be around per say.

I'm now 21 years old and have realized although I was a social kid and had a decent amount of ""friends"" I never actually felt comfortable connected to anyone. Even my own family members who are by every metric supportive, open, and available feel like familiar strangers or a coworker you might be friendly with at work but nothing else. The people who know me, I would say only know a face I put on that that compliments the box I put them in. I also don't get joy out of life not for any of the reasons most people have that result in self sabotage like bitterness, comparison, anger, entitlement, etc. No matter how much I try, I don't get joy out of life and I would say when I look at what most people enjoy in life it doesn't make any sense because there's no practical reasons to be doing such outside of emotional stimulation which isn't necessary in my opinion. 

I need to be around people otherwise I'll dehumanize others. At that point they are 1's and 0's and become variables in an equation if you will. In fact I find most people irritating because they let emotion have such a dictation over how they make decisions and only if people are competent can I develop some kind of relationship with them but most people are boring to me because they do and say the same things. Nothing they say or do will make me take a second to consider my approach to life which is why I find being around people a bit irritating. 

I'm honestly just trying to make sense of myself to some extent so I can make a decision that would enable me to be as effective as possible. Thanks. ",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dcb4ci/trying_to_figure_myself_out/
901,1dcb3tb,my dad isolates himself from the rest of my family and suffers in silence with his depression/anxiety... how can i help him?,"to start off, i'm 28f and live with my two parents, and my younger brother. 

mental health issues run in my family: i have GAD, my mom has depression. my dad never seemed to struggle with anything except in the last couple of years. we've never had the best relationship; he's always isolated himself in the basement being on his computer (on reddit, watching youtube videos, listening to music, etc). him and my mom don't have the best relationship either, they used to argue all the time when i was growing up but i guess as they got older they couldn't be bothered anymore, they're too tired of it. but only in the last couple of years did i notice the isolation getting worse: he used to at least at dinner with us but now he doesn't, and he barely eats anything. he doesn't come to family gatherings (birthdays or other events), he doesn't even see his own sister anymore (my aunt had a falling out with our family, that may have contributed to his depression/anxiety). 

he went to the doctors just a few months ago to do something about it, after some pushing from me and my mom. he started on SSRIs (lexapro) but then he switched medications because he said it was making him worse. he started paxil now with wellbutrin. i don't notice any significant differences in him and he looks/acts the same. he's still isolating himself and he barely talks to anyone, when he talks to me or my mom he looks down or around, not at us directly, and is kind of like shakey and jittery. 

i think that there's a bunch of issues that have caused his mental health to deteriorate in the last couple of years: his relationship breakdown with his sister, relationship breakdown with my mom (but they still live in the same house), and the fact that we had  to move recently due to our previous landlord selling our house that we rented at the last 25 years. occasionally i check in to ask how he's doing and if the medication is working but he looks and acts the same. he doesn't see a therapist and i doubt he would be comfortable doing that but i'm not 100%. i'm used to talking with my mom about her problems because she's always been an open book and tells me everything (maybe to my detriment)... but with my dad it's hard to know how he feels bc he doesn't open up about his feelings, maybe bc he doesn't want to burden anybody.

TLDR: my dad's depression/anxiety has gotten worse in the last few years/months and doesn't seem to be getting better with medication. anybody else going through something similar with a parent? how can i help?",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dcb3tb/my_dad_isolates_himself_from_the_rest_of_my/
902,1dcad5p,There has never been any meaning in my life. All I have is wealth through my parents.,"Title may be misleading, so I hope I don‚Äòt take away anyone‚Äòs time.

Hey,
I can‚Äòt cope with my lucky upbringing and wealth anymore.

I was raised in a household that wasn‚Äòt quite super rich, but we could always buy what we wanted and money was never a problem.

Furthermore, I am an only child, so there were no arguments about which kid should get this and that, I was always the focal point of my partents. Also I will later be the only one who gets all the wealth like our house from inheritance.

Finally, I come from a country in the EU where salaries are very high and thus, the purchasing power in other countries is even higher, so travelling to other continents was possible (sometimes even multiple times a year)

Recently, I came to think about how lucky I am and calculated numerically in which class of the world population I would fall. I figured out that I belong to the top 500.000 people on this planet when it comes to having a comfortable childhood. Ever since I did this calculation, I wonder about why I deserve this. I have never done anything of much worth beside from few student jobs during the summer holidays. Everything about my life is paid by my parents income or through taxes. Society has given me so much, yet my contribution is low.

I am now a student at an public university in another country and I see my fellow students working hard so they can afford something more in their lives (like going on vacation for example and doing things which improve society) while I just lie in my bed, studying for my exams, and doing absolutely nothing with the money I have, even though I could do so much more to make me more interesting.

I have no real friends in my life, no partner, am autistic and I‚Äòm wondering how I will end up as an working adult. Will I live the same purposeless life I have always done, or will things out better for me, with less unearned money, and how can I contribute more to society so that my life doesn‚Äòt feel like it would be meaningless. I just feel like a massive burden on everyone who has contact with me (like I would take away their time, (see first line)).

When I retire, I would like to die ASAP because then, nobody will have to pay my retirement money through taxes.

Sometimes I just sit at night in a bench in the nearby parc and then I start crying out loud. I‚Äòm doing this so no one can worry about me, which again would feel for me like I just take the time from a potential person who tries to console me.

Can somebody understand my situation?

903,1dca9dr,"OCD, PTSD, Questions about a serious psychological condition.","Hello, friends. I wanted to share my situation here in the hope that I might find people who have been through similar circumstances and have healed. I truly feel desperate and lost, but I have a glimmer of hope that I may find solace here. Essentially, I want to clarify that I suffer from OCD and PTSD. This year, I realized that I cannot control my actions, and whenever I think of something, I feel compelled to do it. I don't mean harm to others, but it harms myself. For example, when I see a trend on X platform about disturbing content like animal torture, I will go and watch it as if I cannot stop myself. I see it, then I enter a severe psychological shock and deep depression. Today, I saw a hashtag of someone torturing a cat, I clicked on it, saw it, then exited the video for a while, but then returned to watch it again. The volume was low, but I raised it and started focusing on the gruesome details. I came out horrified and started crying. I tried to understand why I go to see something that hurts me. I thought maybe I'm trying to reassure myself that things are not that bad and everything is okay. Then why did I come back and raise the volume, which is still lingering in my mind, causing me intense pain? The image does not leave my mind, and it terrifies me. Why do I do this to myself? Many things make me feel like I have no control over myself. I won't go into detail, but this issue is the lion's share of what torments me. I shift from one shock to another and blame myself. I am the one causing this to myself. Now, I can't eat or sleep. When I try to forget, I blame myself. I say, how can I do this while there is a creature suffering? I truly don't know. I hope to find someone to help me or someone who has experienced these symptoms and been diagnosed. I am resisting and have hope for treatment, even though I live in a village with no mental health clinics.

But then I arrived at this house. The first thing I saw was feces on the wall and toilet of the only bathroom which led me to avoid it at all costs plus rotten food animal feces etc.  which in turn made me resort to urinating in bottles and driving to groceries stores to shit. To remain in my comfort bubble of a room. 

This has been happening for over a year and now I have countless urine containers and I have a new better paying job that requires relocation. I‚Äôve been working on disposing of the containers but there‚Äôs so many it‚Äôs inconceivable.

I know this a pathetic post with a pretty harsh stigma attached to the issue at hand but it‚Äôs such a compulsion and I end up hoarding them because of the shame.

I spend most days in my room alone, doing my homework. I do not have siblings nor do I have any neighborhood friends. In the particular neighborhood, it is primarily elderly people.

However, every time I play games, either with stars or countdown, I NEED to get the best grade. With the gold stars, it's pretty easy, simple and not time consuming. I will restart the same level until I get them. The gold stars are not the problem.

I found this YouTube game, Onet Connect, where you have 5 minutes to finish a level. The first time I tried it, it was fun, I got through some levels and didn't think about my usual negative thoughts.
But then I wanted to play the game again and I thought I'd make it through the first level before 1 minute has passed, and for some reason, I've now spent two hours - not on playing the level and then restarting it, no, I've spent two hours on only looking at the level's randomized layout for between 1 to 5 seconds (literally not more than 5 seconds) then have this feeling that it's not good enough and having to restart the level without connecting more than two things.

The worst part is that I know I should just tell myself to relax and try to finish the game and have fun, but I can't. I can't be in my body if I don't restart the level right away, even if I haven't even tried it. It's so uncomfortable and there is this nagging voice that keep saying, that if I keep going, I'll lose terribly and it will show the stats to everyone, which is just not realistic.

Idk if i have depression or anxiety etc,all my life things go wrong for me,and secondary school has been such a deep hell.
1st year,semi edgy emo phase,clears up quick.
I'm quite ugly and chubby but I accepted that long ago. I was loud and energetic too,very annoying, sociable tho. 
For some reason in my English class i voiced controversial opinions,I don't even believe in,and that was bad,idk why maybe I did it for attention because no one notices me.So that already fucked up people's view of me.i want to reset.I've seen the videos,people hanging out after school,doing fun trends together,having exciting moments. I tried to get attention in bad ways .i don't remember much from it anymore.
2nd year: it was terrible,worst year of my life,I got really awkward,like REALLY. I can't make eye contact anymore,I start sweating and get red in public/school,so I start of with a shitty reputation,so at the start of 2nd year,I focused on school,ALOT,crying every night about grades and trying to forget the previous year,all I thought of was grades and the tests,so I finish exams,and during Christmas that's when it began,that it all stopped,I can't feel anything anymore. And it all got worse from there. So it's now January,and I  wanted meaning in my life. Then strings of embarrassing things start to happen,I get really red when in public due to stress alot,I start sweating  alot then, then my stomach starts rumbling during class,but mostly in my geography one,so the 2 people on my desk look at me weirdly while I try cover/play it off. I can't make eye contact anymore,oh yeah,we had to do speeches in English and when everyone in class was saying their topics,apparently mine sounded like I was supporting fatphobia,which I wasn't,so I changed my title and apologised during my speech,so that just made it worse. There are multiple,multiple  awkward moments I made for myself during school,that are to long for me to list,but just know they just made my life,more of a living hell in each step,more then I can put in words ever to show even  a fraction of the hell its caused me. Also,one of my closer ish friends has been trying to tease/embaras me all the time,but if I cut her off I will be such a  loner in class because she is in every class I have due to chance. I don't find anything fun anymore,when I laugh with friends it's forced,I have no joy in my hobbies anymore. 
But something has saved me from this ,technology,I constantly play videos and video games ,I don't think anymore with it bluring my thoughts,so now my dad gets pissed that it fills most of my day. And everyone says  ""get support if you are struggling"",my mum says it's too expensive rn,and that I should be fine,when I told her I don't feel anything anymore,she looked at me like I was faking.when I told my friend(that i mentioned)that a certain subject gives me certain episodes,she ,like my mum,tried downplaying it by saying ""well yk depression is a emotion you get"" and moved on.

I have a good and well paying job in the STEM field, a girlfriend, and a fairly tidy and nice looking apartment. I wake up, drive to work, conduct meetings, do presentations and complete my tasks, all with great praise from my coworkers and boss, and when I come home, I cook and clean with my girlfriend, work on various personal projects and so on. I finished my master's degree early, been practicing the violin for a year or so now, and recently started learning French. I consider myself to be quite intelligent.

But I feel like something is really fucking wrong with me and I am just pretending to be normal. At work, I regularly spend a long time in the bathroom just masturbating and snorting my own piss. During meetings from home, I am sometimes tied up to my chair and inflating my bladder through a catheter or shitting in a diaper I am wearing. I have bought medical equipment and tried to intubate myself until 4 in the morning on a work day and all kinds of shit. I once wore an NG tube connected to an automatic pump containing alcohol, went downtown, and basically just walked around while alcohol was being pumped directly into my stomach. Ended up getting super drunk and vomiting in the subway, and the tube came out of my mouth. I regularly get 3-5 hours of sleep per night. Whenever my girlfriend is not home, I tend to stop showering or eating much and I simply piss in bottles instead of using the toilet. One time I was up for almost 3 days straight just doom scrolling and filling my colon with water over and over again and I barely had anything to eat or drink, and my body shut down and I genuinely thought I was going to die. I feel like I have no empathy and don't care about anything. I don't feel happiness. I am always angry and just trying to endure whatever is pissing me off, or if I am lucky I just feel indifferent. I regularly scream and punch the walls if I get frustrated and I am alone. Or I punch, bite and stab myself.

Years ago, I used to do drugs and was close to overdosing multiple times. I have some evil, cold and antisocial tendencies and sexual desires that I don't want to describe in details, but it's basically just a fear of getting in trouble that's keeping me away from certain things. I have done some unpleasant things to people without their knowledge. I have never purposefully attempted suicide, and I don't want to die or anything, but I enjoy hurting myself. And I keep having this weird fear when I am alone that I will see something that's not real. As I am writing this, I keep looking behind me, knowing that there's nothing there, but fearing that my mind has finally broken and for some reason decided that there is indeed some scary ghost girl standing behind me or some shit like that. I am afraid that, one day, I look into the mirror and my face looks different or looks all disfigured. Or when I look out the window, I am afraid I see a face staring back at me. It's not that I think any of this is actually real, but I am afraid that, one day, something inside my brain will finally break and I will start having hallucinations.

In November of last year, a friend of mine wanted to go out for thanksgiving because he was alone.

He convinced me to drink and keep going to other spots (I know I‚Äôm an adult and make my own decisions), so I don‚Äôt blame him at all for me staying out.

I didn‚Äôt wreck or anything but an officer woke me up and ultimately took me to jail for DUI. They took my license for 18mo and I have about 12mo to go. 

Fast forward, I was set to get off probation next week since I finished everything. I got a new apartment in town to be more centralized. I had nobody to drive my car and stuff to my new place. The movers moved a lot but didn‚Äôt get some things. I could‚Äôve asked someone to drive my car, but I didn‚Äôt. ‚Äî I ended up getting pulled over and the officer saw a lot of my belongings in the car. He took me to jail again for driving with a suspended license. I begged him to let me go. I broke no laws he said other than he ran my plate and saw I had no license. I bonded out but I know I‚Äôm going back because of violation of probation. I‚Äôm $12k in the hole for what happened in November and expecting another $5k estimated for getting pulled over trying to move my belongings. My fresh start just feels like a nightmare now. 

My lawyer said expect to go back to jail for the VOP and I could be there for 5-10 days. I‚Äôll probably get out and get back on probation, fines, and more community hours. I know I messed up. I just wish I had more family and friends for support. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still my fault. 

I feel so helpless. I‚Äôm going broke and so much is on the line now. My job, car, apartment I just got. I don‚Äôt even have anyone to watch my dog while I‚Äôm away.

So i'm in my  early 20s and I'm not sure if i'm suffering from some sort of memory loss. I've been thinking about this for awhile but just assumed maybe it was normal.

I've realised that if I think back to my past I can't remember almost anything up to a certain point. I have key memories mainly bad or associated with trauma that I still remember clearly and some happy memories but they're all disjointed, not in any particular order and are at various points in my life.

I can't really remember my school life or before until I was around 16. I graduated university 2 years ago and my memories of university are already fading, again I remember certain memories but can't tell you what I really did in the 3 years I was there.

I can't recall what I've done recently as in last week and also when I go out with friends or do something in my leisure time when I think back to what I've done at the end of the day it feels like I wasn't really there and I'm thinking back to a sort of dream where I'm just floating through it. I feel like i'm not really present in those moments, like I can be happy and having a good time or whatever but once i'm out of that situation I kinda forget what it's like to be there if that makes any sense. For example a lot of my memories with my best friend I don't really recall anymore, I went to go and see her a few months ago and I can only partially remmeber what we even did, talked about, etc

I've been thinking a lot about my behavior towards other people over the last few weeks. I'm a people pleaser and it's really bothering me.

On the other hand, the associated overthinking and anxiety the day after is extremely exhausting. After a meeting (especially with people I don't know that well), I can't think about anything other than the fact that I've behaved strangely and they probably don't even like me anyway.

","Hello All, I would like to share my story. My name is Angel and I‚Äôm just 21 years old. I was looking forward for my CDL Class A training but was on a halt.

I got diagnosed with KC (Keratoconus) about 3 months ago. No Eye issues before, No glasses, No Contacts, just a case of bad luck. I Worked at a tree company for a year, then I sweated for a year of brutal work, 16 hour shifts, storm calls, taking trees off power lines for merely 20/hr etc etc‚Ä¶ and was looking forward to getting a Class B CDL. Then the company screwed me over so I left. I had enough after dealing with a lot of BS and racial incidents and knew I was just a number once again, bunch of false promises. 

Anyways, Worked there for a CDL B and never got it after all but it was okay I had saved up money for it. So A year of planning anyways I was hustling lol.I had my plan, Went to a DOT physical and I failed the eye exam due to having blurry vision on my right eye. Next thing you after 4 doctors all saying I have KC, I have found one that finally make contacts and takes insurance, Its been about of month, insurance is covering the contacts but I just been waiting. And waiting. It's special hard lens contacts, not like a over the counter contacts you can buy at a pharmacy store.



I‚Äôm getting to a depressive point. Struggling to sleep now. This is the longest I haven‚Äôt worked in 3 years. I went from working at Fedex at 18 then quit there after a year 1/2+ and jumped to this other company a day after then proceeded to worked there for a year. So Basically, this was my first vacation in 3 years after working non stop 50+ hours weeks. But now it‚Äôs not in my hands‚Ä¶man, I don‚Äôt like not having control on something I can‚Äôt do anything about‚Ä¶I haven‚Äôt told my significant other yet, nor my family but it finally caught up after 3 months of not working. I‚Äôm a workaholic‚Ä¶.clearly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶But this, after 3 months this is now really taking a toll. Just feeling low and unmotivated.

 Been doordashing recently to make income just for gas tbh and little smalls dates for my girl because honestly, she‚Äôs been great, understanding and actually helpful and not put me down. (Dealt with toxicity beforehand with others so learning on healthy aspects and traits so bless her man.)Once I‚Äôll get my contacts, I‚Äôll be doing still the CDL school 8am to 4pm then working PT or possibly FT, really not liking the idea at working at Fedex again but I‚Äôm leaning too it at this point‚Ä¶ hard to find a 6pm-10pm shift jobs in my area.‚Ä¶Not sure it‚Äôll be brutal but I should be able to do it and still study. I mean, it‚Äôll be temporary for 2 months anyways.

I just want to make everyone proud.

926,1dchl1a,Depression? ,"Tldr- wisdom teeth removed and got depression

Hi guys, just recently got back from a Holiday and had my wisdom teeth removed. I had no pain or anything and recovered smoothly, however I am now insanely sad, at any given moment of time I can go from so happy to crying. Bit of a back story I've had a horrible couple of years with the passing of my father and alot of other events, but I've pushed through and been surprisingly optimistic, but after the surgery things went downhill.

Now what is curious about this is that I will be fine, then I'll get an insane anxious energy, where I basically will need to run, (I hate running) I'll go for a 5km + run and I'll start crying whilst running. I describe the pre symptoms as almost like a bee swarm in my stomach.
Then I just run it out and am still sad afterwards, but it then passes and it almost didn't happen.

I'm planning on going to see someone I just want to know if this is something people experience or if anyone could try explain this so I feel like I'm more equipped?

I have been friends with a girl around my age (20 yo, I'm 21) since november last year. We go to uni together and have grown very close quickly, to the point we text every day and hang out often.

Details: >! Over the time we spent together I absolutely cherished her friendship. I rarely feel compatibility like this when I'm with someone, to the point I have developed romantic feelings. It was a very slow burn, admittedly with me pushing back on any love to avoid compromising what we already have. !<

Recently I spoke to some friends about my romantic interest in her and they insisted I should give it a shot, so I did. I didn't tell her straight up, but I started showing more interest, some flirting wich she sometimes reciprocated and, for a few days, goodnight/good morning texts.

I figured she'd appreciate them. She never replied with much emotion, but didn't seem bothered either. Two days ago, I sent the text and she replied the following day, after leaving it on read, with a random sticker.

She's not supposed to reply in a specific way or right away. She doesn't owe me a reply either. She didn't really say anything about it. Nothing really happened. But yesterday I felt completely depressed, cried for the first time in years. I felt like that was her telling me she's uncomfortable with that and that I just imagined any romantic hint I might have picked up on. The sticker is really an excuse for not replying, or so I think.

This happened yesterday, but I've been like this for years. Whenever I step into anything regarding love I crumble in the wind. Never been in a relationship mostly because of this. I'm normally not very sensitive.

Is this normal? I'm concerned with how easily my mood drops. She didn't really do a thing, but I'm reading a lot into that and pretty much creating problems in my mind. Am I right in doing that? Maybe I should just talk to her about it?",3,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dchhkv/am_i_just_way_too_sensitive_do_i_overthink/
929,1dchffo,My brother had psychotic relapse ,"My 28-year-old brother got engaged to a girl, but unfortunately, she ran away with someone else. This caused him immense pain and he had a psychotic episode. Although he was harmless, he lost consciousness and was speaking to voices. We took him to a psychiatrist and, with medication, he miraculously recovered. He was committed to doing well, worked out daily, and the doctor gradually reduced his medication.
He was also involved in good hobbies, doing very well at work. 

At 30, He wanted to get married, so we found another family, and everything went smoothly. However, after his second engagement, he unexpectedly had another episode(around 14 months after first). he had lack of sleep for couple of days and started showing the signs. So we took him to hospital.The doctor mentioned that seasonal changes could also trigger this. His medication dosage has been increased again: Sulpitac 200mg, Encorate Chrono 500mg, and Lopez 2mg.

I am scared. We initially informed the girl's family about his stress and medication, but this recurrence is worrisome. I feel completely clueless.

He is still recovering. Is there some way to prevent this from happening? Should I seek additional medical help.

Can't is the worst word that's written or spoken; 
Doing more harm here than slander and lies; 
On it is many a strong spirit broken, 
And with it many a good purpose dies.
It springs from the lips of the thoughtless each morning 
And robs us of courage we need through the day: 
It rings in our ears like a timely-sent warning 
And laughs when we falter and fall by the way. 

Can't is the father of feeble endeavor, 
The parent of terror and half-hearted work; 
It weakens the efforts of artisans clever, 
And makes of the toiler an indolent shirk. 
It poisons the soul of the man with a vision, 
It stifles in infancy many a plan; 
It greets honest toiling with open derision 
And mocks at the hopes and the dreams of a man. 

Can't is a word none should speak without blushing; 
To utter it should be a symbol of shame; 
Ambition and courage it daily is crushing; 
It blights a man's purpose and shortens his aim. 
Despise it with all of your hatred of error; 
Refuse it the lodgment it seeks in your brain; 
Arm against it as a creature of terror, 
And all that you dream of you some day shall gain. 


Can't is the word that is foe to ambition, 
An enemy ambushed to shatter your will; 
Its prey is forever the man with a mission 
And bows but to courage and patience and skill. 
Hate it, with hatred that's deep and undying, 
For once it is welcomed 'twill break any man; 
Whatever the goal you are seeking, keep trying 
And answer this demon by saying: ""I can.""

So, how do I stop comparing myself to people, and how do I stop panicking that my life is going to go by too quickly? If I live in the present it won‚Äôt be as bad because I won‚Äôt be worrying about the future. 

Idk, also how do you stop being jealous, or envious? It makes me feel guilty and like shit tbh.

938,1dcfztw,My healing journey ,"My journey of healing from trauma has been a rough road. Recently I've been posting on Instagram and reddit about incidents that have happened to me over my 27 years of living. I battles with physical, verbal emocional and sexual abuse for years. I kept a lot bottled up for years in my attempt to ""not seem as I'd I was attention seeking."" A quote heavily thrown around my in my family towards my mental health struggles growing up. 

My last suicide attempt was in 2021, two years after I was sexually assauted. My assailant was dragging the court case along with continuance after continuance and I had finally grown so weak I could no longer take how utterly mentally exhausted I was. Clearly my attempt at taking my life did not work and I am so grateful it did not, however the reaction I was met with by my family was harsh and still haunts me to this day. My eldest sister posted on a comment of one of her Facebook quotes that I was ""one attention seeking suicide attempt away from losing my son.""
I know I will never see an apology from that woman. And I'm coming to terms with it. I've been doing a lot of introspection these past few months. Thinking about my childhood abuse and neglect and seeing how it has grown to affect me as an adult. Through therapy I have learned my toxic traits and what they mean and how they manifested themselves. 
My biggest toxic trait is that I don't seek help until it is often times too late. I sprial into the dark place and find myself scared to ask for help.
My other toxic trait is my love for validation. Seeking it out in anyway possible. I never knew that as an adult, it would grow into my wanting to have the last word sometimes until it was pointed out to me by my therapist. I was told it was because I was ""arrogant"" and ""egotistical."" But it's in my search of my opinion and needs being validated that I want the last word. Not to save a fragile ego. 
While I continue my journey, sharing my pain as a child, through social media, I feel it has helped me heal. Yes, I satisfy that toxic trait of validation, but I also get to tell my story. To get it off my chest. And I need that. I need to have my story heard, because what I've been put through was not right and I need to except it. I am proud to be shouting from the roof tops about injustice. It is my right. And I will continue it. I will continue to heal and end my suffering in the cycle of abuse that was my life.

940,1dceyh8,I think I‚Äôm bipolar but no one will listen to me.,"Let me start out first by saying, I(18F) am in no way trying to self diagnose. This is something that I have been struggling with for a few years now, but everytime I try to talk to someone about it, it always gets dismissed. My first therapist I tried telling about this issue, said it was normal and just a part of puberty, and everyone feels this way and goes through this. Of course, she sent me to the hospital to get a psych evaluation when I mentioned offing myself, but didn‚Äôt think once that maybe this correlates to what I was trying to tell her. And then just recently, when I tried telling my current therapist, she said that it was because my PERIOD can cause mood swings. MOOD SWINGS. 

I went home crying that day because I finally worked up the courage to tell her about the shit I‚Äôve been going through most of my life, and she blamed it on my period. It hurt so bad to hear that from her, and to once again be ignored by someone I thought i could tell anything too. 

To be clear on what‚Äôs going on, and why I think i might be bipolar, is because I go through episodes where sometimes I feel intense emotions, and other times I feel absolutely nothing, which leads to very dangerous situations. In the past, (and present) during these episodes I often relapse on self harm, and drinking. I go into a headspace where I just don‚Äôt think or feel anything and therefore loose any reason to not drink/self harm. And in the episodes where I feel too much, it‚Äôs a huge crash of emotions, relapsing on the same things, lashing out on the ones I love most, and loosing opportunities because I‚Äôm too upset or angry to do anything, but lash out. 

These episodes come and go, i get a few weeks (or less) of peace, and then their back, and normally last weeks, to a month. And no, it does not match up with my period cycle. I know exactly how period mood swings are, this isn‚Äôt that. And just one more thing, I don‚Äôt ever remember much after the episodes end. Like I really couldn‚Äôt tell you what happened during that time, because I wasn‚Äôt mentally present for it. 

So in conclusion, can someone please help me figure this out. Let me know what you think this is, and if it does sound like bipolar disorder, how do I get my therapist to listen?? I really need people to stop brushing this issue off, it affects my life deeply, and I need help.

942,1dcfxnb,Comparing myself to white girls ,"I miss who I was before my last relationship. He always hooked up with white girls behind my back. I never had anything against them I‚Äôm not racist but I‚Äôm fucking Mexican, I know I‚Äôm not ugly I‚Äôve been compared to Kali Uchis, and Kim Kardashian which are very beautiful women. I could never be like a white girl tho. One day I told him I didn‚Äôt think I was his type bc all he did was get with white girls behind my back and he told me I was and that he did like me. Next day he goes on snapchat and I had the urge to tell him to look someone up to make sure he didn‚Äôt have them added, on snapchat it shows the history of who‚Äôve you searched and you can basically tell what they look like because of the bitmojis. The history was literally all white girls like a row of just 8 white girls.

Idk now when I see a white girl online I just think about how my ex would probably think they‚Äôre so pretty. It‚Äôs been a year and a half since I‚Äôve even been with him and it still crosses my mind every time I see a white girl. At this point it‚Äôs driving me insane. 

(I forgot to add that one of the girls had actually interviewed me a couple months back for a job I really wanted that I had no idea she was at. Of course she didn‚Äôt give me the job all because of this man. She pretended to lose my job application and that honestly set me off even more with insecurity which is why I also couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.)

I also noticed a huge amount of racism towards Romanians all throughout Europe labeling them as ""thieves, scammers, pimps, and prostitutes"". I later learned that the vast majority of prostitutes in Europe are from Romania, so I guess there was some truth behind it.

Your partner was a cheater. Not just physically but emotionally. It‚Äôs normal to compare yourself to the people he cheated on you with, and seeing that common denominator. However ultimately it‚Äôs a moral failing on HIS part. It has nothing to do with your looks, your personality, or your value as a partner. People like that have deep issues, commonly from childhood trauma or abandonment that makes them lack the ability to bond, or they have an addictive personality and go out seeking that next ‚Äúthrill‚Äù which in this case is cheating. 

It‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre not your partners ideal ‚Äútype‚Äù my current partner absolutely has a thing for Latinos, he thinks they‚Äôre gorgeous. Skin color, dark hair, beautiful eyes. I don‚Äôt mind, because I know he also loves me for who I am. 

Don‚Äôt fault yourself in this situation because you‚Äôre not the one to blame. Plenty of men are with partners that don‚Äôt check all their boxes, or find other races more sexually attractive. We‚Äôre human, it‚Äôs okay to look at other people and find them attractive. It‚Äôs not okay to act on those feelings and hurt our current partner in the process. (score: 3) | Bruh Mexican girls are gorgeous. You don't have anything to worry about with that. Your previous SO was just a pig. (score: 2) | Still in the 21st century it seems as tho a white partner is some kind of status symbol to many. Proof of one‚Äôs mettle.
This dude seems like he was out to prove something about himself‚Ä¶perhaps his own inferiority complex?
Anyways, that one is no good for you (score: 2) | This isn‚Äôt about you or white girls, this is about him being an insecure shitbox. Maybe he lands a white gf eventually, you think he‚Äôll be committed to her? No. He‚Äôll chest because that makes him feel whatever emotionally immature thing he‚Äôs tapping into.
Be kind to yourself, don‚Äôt focus on the racial piece of this scenario. Women are beautiful (I feel like a frumpy mom sometimes but need to remind myself of this too!) and we are especially radiant when we embrace our worth, confidence is hot! (score: 2) | Some guys will cheat on the most beautiful girl because it is their life goal to bring them down. They will date you just to fuck you up. You might have to do some inner work to heal the damage he's done but one day you'll meet a guy who loves you for you and doesn't triangulate you with another race of people to lower your self esteem. (score: 2) | Omg‚Ä¶ me but the opposite. Maybe we can learn something about this. My ex boyfriend was hooking up with lots of latinas behind my back during his semester abroad in South America. Ever since I hab a chronich jealousy for EVERY Latin looking girl. It‚Äôs crazy. 
But I think the lesson this could show us is that not while not of color is better. If a guy is cheating, he is the problem. (score: 2) | Hey girl . I really resonate with your experience . I'm Mexican , raised my a traditional Mexican mother , but I was born and have always lived in the US . Growing up in San Diego CA , there was a large Hispanic population but I went to a mostly white school . I wanted to fit in , like most teenagers , and my best friends were white . I didn't fully fit in with the white kids but not fully with the ""paisas"" either . I would hear how people talked about my friends and how pretty they were etc . For a while , I legit WISHED I was white . Why couldn't I have been born with blue eyes and blonde hair . It took a lot of growing up and life experience to get out of that mindset . I feel you , but please know you are beautiful , some might even find you exotic and there's a lot of guys who dig that . In the end , as cheesy as it sounds , who cares about what people think . You are who you are , and the sooner you start focusing on all the good things about you the better , and the likelihood that you'll find a partner that's worthwhile . Love yourself first , and F**K the rest . (score: 2) | Speaking as a white girl, I have male friends who openly say they‚Äôd never date a white girl and would only date latina women. 
I‚Äôm also sure that there‚Äôs a white girl out there super insecure cos her boyfriend loves Mexican women. 
What I‚Äôm trying to say is that every man is different and one losers type shouldn‚Äôt be your baseline of what you think is attractive. 
You just need a new man to gas you up and you‚Äôll forget all about that insecurity! (score: 2) | First of all, a men that really loves you would NOT be hooking up with women of ANY ethnicity behind your back. Im white, i cant relate to what you must be feeling right now but youre worth so much more than what some guy makes you believe youre worth if that makes sense. 

Women of any ethnicity and skin colour and culture are beautiful, ur ex was just a dick

I really hope you regain that confidece youve lost and learn not to compare yourself (score: 1) | That person sounds like a POS. I think you're giving this person a lot of credit to define your beauty.  I have the impression that you internalized that experience as ""white women are more attractive than me"" and that's just not true. He cheated because he's shitty. Plenty of guys consider latina women to be very beautiful and would be faithful to you. Do you find people who cheat attractive? Does it matter what he finds attractive? Does someone else's attractiveness cancel yours? You're attractive. What matters is how you view yourself. (score: 1) | I was/am on the same boat- I had an ex that would cheat on me with white girls and definitely developed an inferiority complex. But now I‚Äôm dating someone who (ironically also only went for white girls lol and I‚Äôm Asian) thinks I‚Äôm beautiful and makes that known every day. I‚Äôm still working on it but it helps to self-affirm. (score: 1) | I had and still have the same thing but about exes. The first guy I was madly inlove with was obsessed with his ex and always made me feel not good enough to be his first thought. I left and it broke my heart because I never got closure. That insecurity stained my next relationships which were very surface level and sometimes destructive. Until I met my now husband who only has eyes for me and is everything a girl can dream of. He also has an ex he is friends with but this never makes me feel insecure because he never gives me a reason to be. True, I never want to meet the girl since the idea still makes me feel uncomfortable but it doesn‚Äôt tear at my soul and self esteem anymore. So yeah I‚Äôd say forget about the guy even though it might hurt now and focus on things that make you happy and a guy who appreciates you will walk in eventually. (score: 1) | I'm so sorry you had to go through this. It's bad enough when men fetishize specific aspects about women generally, but when it's around race it's cruel on a whole other level, and nobody deserves that.

I had a similar situation; I'm on the spectrum and my ex-partner would never accept it, but would go out of his way to compare me to more neurotypical women and say all the ways I was ""weird"" compared to them. It took years, but one day I got a message from a friend that highlighted one of those ""weird"" traits of mine as something that brought her joy every time we spoke, and I started to work on picking out how these things that make me different made people smile.

I hope you can do something similar, but mostly just focus on taking time, loving yourself and looking for people in your life, friends or partners, who love you the same way.

If you're compared to her then you can be like a white girl if you really wanted to, but it's also not the real issue. (score: 1) | Therapy.

(score: 1) | Once to realize how many girls (like the kardashians) want to look like people like you and how beautiful your culture is you‚Äôll fall in love with yourself more! I would start to follow more people who look like you and see if you can copy they‚Äôre style and then you can find a medium in between what you look like and how to dress like the people you follow . 
I hope anything from this helps, I‚Äôm black and Mexican hated my skin and genuinely wanted to cut my skin off cause I hate everything about me but there are alot of people I‚Äôve come to realize love the natural me and will never look like me naturally so I try to love the things that make me , me! (score: 1) | black girl here, i feel ur pain every single guy i‚Äôve liked has picked a white girl over me even if she‚Äôs not necessarily interesting or a nice person :/ guys can be dumb but i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre beautiful!!

But it was always a problem with him, not you. This man‚Äôs eyes shouldn‚Äôt be how you see the world, bc Mexican girls have something white girls do not that is special too. Idk how to take it further than that but there‚Äôs a specialness and beauty you have that they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs the spectrum of beauty between women. Most men aren‚Äôt even like this so just free yourself from him as a thought. Evict him from your mind. (score: 1) | I understand to some degree. I‚Äôve always appreciated Mexican culture since I grew up in the SW. My bf cheated on me with a pretty Mexican woman (I‚Äôm white) and we stayed together. Ever since then every time there‚Äôs a pretty Mexican girl around us, I‚Äôm tv or anything related to Mexican culture I get completely insecure. I wonder if he‚Äôs thinking about her or has a fetish of some sort. 
Cheating is more about variety as opposed to a type, it took me awhile to realize that. I thought I was his type and turns out whatever they have they‚Äôll want something else. I‚Äôm sorry you were made to feel this way! I‚Äôm still working through this feeling. (score: 1) | Your ex is the problem not you. (score: 1) | I'm a white girl, who was cheated on by my ex with many other types of women. Some thinner than me, some bigger than me, of various ethnicities, so I understand how you feel to a point.

He made me compare myself to all kinds of women, and now I compare myself to non-white people because I just feel like I'll ""expire"" faster because ""black don't crack, asian don't raisin"" etc, because half of the women he cheated on me with weren't white. And this was full on having double lives with each of us, not that getting drunk and cheating once is much better, but  methodically playing us all at different times, really messed me up. I was just the ""main"" chick in the whole messed up dynamic.

He would even sit there and thumb through Instagram models while I was laying right next to him. I would watch him contemplate liking the picture, then scroll on by until he found one that was ""good"" enough.

The thing you gotta try and remind yourself is that these insecurities didn't just magically appear. That this guy made you feel inferior to other women, and made you feel ""not good enough"" because nobody, and I mean *nobody* will ever be good enough for him, or anybody like him.

Serial cheaters tend to just continually cheat, whether it's because they lack impulse control, or they try to fill a gaping hole within their own selves that is never full no matter what, whether it's because they're narcissists, whatever it is, - it's not your fault, and I hope you don't ever stay in a dynamic like that ever again because you don't deserve it!

It's been 8 years since this dude hurt me and I still can't bring myself to find someone because the mind games he played were just too great.
What I hope for you is that you can move past what you went through in a healthier way than I could have, and remember - it was *him* that wasn't good enough for *you* - not the other way around! ü§ç (score: 1) | I‚Äôm a white woman who wishes she was Latina. Want to trade? 
Srsly Latinas are actually the new beauty standard - did you know that? If your ex is a POC he might be into white women because of that, or from media or whatever other reasons people prefer one race. 
But really I‚Äôve thought about posting on Reddit or talking to my therapist about it (but I can‚Äôt bc she‚Äôs Latina as were my last couple ones. My city is latino majority). Lots of Latinas are just naturally perfect looking and have the best genes and bodies. I look at them when I‚Äôm out and I feel shitty about myself that I don‚Äôt have a big ass and that I wasn‚Äôt born into the right family with the right genes. 

But what I think is actually going on here is that the deck is still stacked against ALL women. White men are still the aesthetic default for what‚Äôs considered the most attractive by the media, Hollywood etc but women of color are fetishized and now the Latina look is the new default for women. The media cycles through which face/body part/fashion it wants to make money off, churns out a product and makes anyone who doesn‚Äôt look like that feel like shit. Women are the objects that are supposed to change their look or damn personality for the approval of men, and we can never win because there‚Äôs always a new look. And when it‚Äôs about race, it‚Äôs extra fucked because we can‚Äôt change our race! 

So just be yourself and there will be ton of people who are into you. Hopefully you find some that aren‚Äôt swayed by trends and porn and the media and like you as a whole person not just your appearance! That‚Äôs unfortunately what we‚Äôre up against as women, but I have to believe there are good men out there. 

I can introduce you to my ex if you want, I think he‚Äôs into Latinas now bc most white liberal millenial dudes are and he started going salsa dancing and learning Spanish. But he‚Äôs probably poly and may have cheated on me. Want his number?

(score: 0) | My ex gf thought I have a thing for asian women because I was following a bunch of them on Instagram and making complements about them. I don't know your boyfriend, but I wouldn't jump into such conclusions. It's a complicated matter, but think. Why on earth would he be with you if he only cares about the white girls? Doesn't make sense. Or am I missing something? 

He might have a thing for white girls or he may not. Perhaps it changes in his head from time to time. The thing is to love yourself and not let anyone else determine your value. Don't let your own overthinking determine your value. White girls are just like any others. Maybe try making a friend with one of them? (score: -7) | Well if that‚Äôs not your type why do you follow a bunch of them? (score: 1) | As well as bunch of Asian guys? I was always dreaming about traveling throughout Asia. But her thinking this way made me totally abandon this dream. At least for now. + Asian people have ""cute"" features other races don't. But that doesn't mean I have a thing for them. This applies to every single race. I find Latinos, black, white as exciting and beautiful as asians. Just every race in it's own way. Is there anything wrong with that??

She has done so many terrible things to my dad's side of the family. Here are some examples. She is neglectful to my little siblings (her and my dad's kids). She forcefully shaved my legs when I was 8 and I was crying and begging her to stop. I now hate shaving my legs because of her. Also, she's one of the reasons my mental health is garbage.

one of my coping mechanisms for bad things is maladaptive daydreaming. It's basically where you daydream more than the normal person (that's how I explain it anyway. probably not the best explanation but whatever. google it if it doesn't make sense). It's gotten worse after every bad event (for example, family members going to the hospital for an emergency, stepmom being a bitch, life being stressful).

I've done it so much during bad events that I don't know any other coping mechanisms. I don't know my emotions on this. I don't know if I'm sad, mad, or both. I don't know how to handle my emotions or bad events in healthy ways. I can't go to therapy because my mom wouldn't believe me if I told her that I daydream to deal with bad events (and other mental health stuff).

954,1dcdfjw,I had to change therapist from 6 years ago because she insists in being my friend,"I (37F) had this former friend who had a lot of mental issues and witneseed her suferring for long time. Suddendly i saw she was getting better and better and even got a job and began studying a new career! I was so happy for her. I asked what helped and she told me she found an amazing therapist. She recommended me with her, and it actually worked for me, she helped me a lot.

She's a psychologist, also like anime and games as I do, but the thing that made me uncomfortable was everytime I said i felt lonely and abandoned, and that I wasn't good at making friends, she said ""hey i can be your friend too, you are so cool"".  
And i kept saying many times that i don't want to mix things up. Besides most of the therapy sessions were just venting and her listening and validating, and I told her several times that asking me to consider her a friend made me feel i was paying her to be a friend for me. It also reminded me when i was a kid and used to tell my mother (narcissistic) that i wanted friends and she replied saying ""but you have me, mom is your friend"", so it creeps me out hearing this from the psychologist that is treating me.  
We hang out a couple of times, because yes, i tried to see if befriending her was a good idea, but i didn't feel comfortable so i avoided any further invitation.  
I told her i never get  presents for my birthday and for one of them she sent me a huge box with chocolates and a plush (i am  terrified of plushes and felt bad she didn't consider that) but I was awkwardly thankful anyways.

I stopped attending therapy with her because I have over a year without seeing improvements or differences in treatment and just speaking doesn't always work, I need guidance in working on my recovery. So I found another therapist with a different approach, so far it has been intense and painful but I feel it's working, she opened the gate to other inner demons i wasn't aware of (codependency and cptsd).

Was I rude with my previous therapist without saying anything? We still follow each other in social media (we have contacts in common too) and still interact via memes. Did someone have a similar experience where your therapist wanted to befriend you?

  
TL;DR: I stopped seeing my previous therapist because she insisted that we could be friends too. Did I do the right thing?

",3,4,new,"Yeah, you did the right thing. We have different personalities for different people we meet. And the way you behave or listen to a friend is way different than the way you'll listen to a psychologist. You wouldn't have been sincere to her advice if you started to consider her as a friend. Although, now that you've changed your therapist you can be friends with her and let's see if she still wanna be friends with you now or it was just ""i waana be friends with you for your money"" kind of thing.

Like, if you're bored and you went to play golf and you met another person playing golf. You two became friends. Then the other person got married to someone and stopped coming for golf.

We had conversations about what it meant to live together, we discussed household duties and responsibilities, we discussed a variety of topics that couples should discuss when making this step.  At the beginning of the relationship, I was adamant on many occasions that I was looking for a relationship of equality:   equal responsibilities, equal effort, etc.  (We are adults and do not need one person leading or spoon-feeding/coddling the other.)  Moving in together is supposed to be a next-step in the relationship, propelling it forward.  Forward steps in a relationship are supposed to result in the relationship growing and getting better.  That didn't happen.  Shortly after he moved in, I noticed that he was reducing his efforts in the relationship.

He never initiated ""check-in"" conversations.  It's important to have these conversations fairly often to discuss the relationship and how it's going.  I initiated every single one.

He said ILY less often, and was first to say it less often.  (Previously in the relationship, he complained that I wasn't saying it enough and I wasn't saying it first enough.  So I put forth more effort to meet his need.)

He reduced the amount of affection he offered me.  I was the one initiating hugs and kisses and affection.  (Previously in the relationship, he complained that I wasn't offering enough affection.  So I put forth more effort to meet his need.)

He stopped initiating sx and had no enthusiasm for our sx life.  We went from 3x per week to 1x per week.  When I questioned this, he assured me that his needs were being met.  (Previously in the relationship, he complained that we weren't having sx enough, so I put forth more effort to meet his needs by initiating sx more often.)

He never asked me questions about me or my life.  He showed very little interest in continuing to get to know me and increase non-sxual intimacy.  When I leaned on him for emotional support, he offered me the minimum and didn't say much in response.

I realized I was making most of the effort and he was making very little effort.  It turned out to be a 90/10 relationship, and I realized that he had been lying to me all along and was using me for his own personal gain.  I call some of his actions a bait-and-switch.

I don't believe them of course, but if literally everyone is disagreeing with me, I tried to pull myself out of my own shoes and consider that my point of view is probably biased. 

What that means is that you're likely nowhere near as unattractive as you think you are. Self-hatred forms really strong cognitive biases that will make you believe something about yourself even if every piece of external evidence suggests otherwise. 

Now, self-improvement is healthy (working out, eating right, skincare, etc) and that's a healthy way to address your concerns about the way you may look. But hating yourself for it and moving to self harm isn't the right approach, only because it's so extremely unlikely that people find you as ""ugly"" as you find yourself. 

Finally, looks (apparently) aren't everything, as I've been told and seen for myself many times in the world. Sure, being pretty helps, but it's definitely not something to end your life over. Everyone on earth deserves love, and usually gets it. Just try to be objective and think about the quality of your self-talk. When you start feeling unattractive and degrading yourself for it, try to catch yourself and say ""no, shut up"" because those are most likely biased, twisted self-denigrating thoughts and they don't represent reality. Take it easy, and when you feel ready, do what you can to improve yourself so you have fewer reasons to think that way about yourself. But the first step is to stop the negative self-talk. Once you practice that enough, you can start positive self-talk.

Financially speaking, I don't have a bad life. Nothing too fancy but I own a small business, own my house, a couple of vehicles ,and live without financial distress. 

When I was around 13 I attempted against myself and I always thought I would then do it once I'm older. I never considered aging and living to the end of my natural life. Lately, I as I am 33, there's been this urge. I have come to understand today I'm physically healthy, things are okay, my family is okay, everything and everyone I care are fine. And this is a good time but because of this, I've come to terms, that before it gets bad, it would be ideal to end things while it's good.

I attempted about 2 months ago and was sent to a mental hospital. I stayed there for 3 days. I explained I came to this moment due to being drunk and stressed about life. I did not share full honesty as my intention was to get out as quickly as possible because my business needed me.

Now, I attempted again despite my best efforts and I've come to the conclusion, with the advice of my therapist, that I should seek help in a mental institution as I'm in high risk. I'm annoyed that I can't change myself by just trying.

Now, if I fully share all that's wrong, as in opposite of explaining things, as temporary and circumstantial, I would expect to be there for a long period. Will I get used to it? Will I actually get help? Will I be back out being better? I'm worried.

TLDR: I'm tempted to break up with my partner because I'm not in love with him, he's made false promises and I don't find him attractive anymore, but I would lose out on my opportunity to escape my horrible living conditions.

Me (20M) and my partner (19M) have been dating for over 2 years, and had a rocky relationship to begin with, but it's finally smoothened out over the past 7-8 months. We still have some issues, for example, he's lying about job applications, but it's significantly better. I, however, just don't feel the love anymore. He doesn't warm my heart up like how he used to. I know relationships are cyclical, but I've felt this way for weeks now. I've tried 'reigniting the spark' but nothing is working. 

I think I realised this when I was calling a (straight male) friend and he made a flirtatious joke. It was obviously a joke, we both laughed, but I blushed. And I had that warm feeling in my heart again. I haven't felt that feeling for months. I don't have a crush on this friend, I'm strictly loyal, but my god it felt so good to have someone say something flirtatious about me without it feeling forced. This, as well as the fact I just don't find my partner physically attractive anymore (having to close my eyes whenever we do the deed). He hasn't changed physically either, he still dresses and presents himself the same way as well. 

I'm supposed to be moving in with him and his family in a couple of months time. This is something I've been waiting on for YEARS. My current home life is fucking miserable. My mum is absent, leaving me to take care of my younger sister and the house whilst I'm also a full time student, working as much as I can, and struggling with mental health issues. I can't afford to pay for all the bills and food, so there's a constant threat and worry of anything being cut off (electricity, water, gas, internet etc) since my mum isn't paying for any of it. I've had some days where I don't eat just so my sister can eat. I've looked at other ways I can move out, and none of them are currently feasible. This situation is making my depression and anxiety even worse.

The issue is, I don't want to move in with my partner if I'm not happy with our relationship, because if the relationship doesn't improve then I'm fucked, and moving back home would cost a lot of money I don't have. 

I don't know what to do. If I break up with him and stay living at home, I could get a full time job (since my studies will finish soon) so the financial situation at home improves, but I also just fucking hate where I live. I live in a small town and because of my mum being a drunkard, random people know about her and I get people at work asking if I'm her son. I just want to leave this fucking town as soon as I can because I can't stand it anymore.

Depression is an evil thing in my opinion and was completely consuming me. It personally took me a lot of courage to admit that to myself and then even more courage to ask for help. 

This is where I was lost, first time in my life dealing with this and completely on my own after leaving a 24 year relationship and losing a business during the multiple lockdown s from COVID.

I self-isolate and sleep as much as possible. I wake up, work, and go back to sleep ASAP. If I can't fall asleep (which is rare), I'll take CBD and doom scroll until I can sleep. I know that I'm young and shouldn't be sleeping my life away, but sleeping is a lot easier than facing everything. 

When things get really bad, I force myself to remember the looks on my parents faces after my sister passed and our family trips to the cemetery - those painful memories remind me that I have to keep going for them. As long as they‚Äôre alive, I will not be the reason they have to bury another child. 

I am fully aware none of this is healthy, so here's a list of things that are healthy (but I'm usually too hypocritical to do lol): 

- Journaling (if you don't know what to write, there are thousands of reflective journal prompts you can find online)  

- Meditation (guided meditations are great, I've used Headspace and enjoyed it, but YouTube has good free ones) 

- Exercise (god I hate being told this, but it does help, unfortunately lol). Doesn't have to be the gym though, anything to get your body moving works, walks, dancing, swimming, etc.. 

- Cleaning/organizing; very hard for some people to be motivated to do this (its me, I'm ""some people""), but it's a lot easier to manage internal distress when your external environment isn't also in distress. 

- Socializing. Even if you're not talking about your mental health, just being around others helps. 

- Distractions (hobbies). Find ways to get out of your own head and do something else; video games, puzzles, pottery, painting, learning an instrument, gardening, basket weaving, etc., whatever it takes to get you engaged with something other than negative thoughts/feelings. This is another one that can be hard for some people (again, it's me, I'm some people) because loss of interest/pleasure are common symptoms, but sometimes you have to just count to 10 and get moving. 

- Sunlight, being outdoors to get some vitamin D and fresh air can be really beneficial. 

- Make sure you're eating and drinking enough water. Malnutrition and dehydration can make symptoms much worse. 

- Make a routine, it's a lot easier to stick to healthy practices when you do them consistently. We are creatures of habit and replacing bad habits with good ones will help in the long run (even though that's much easier said than done). 

- If you're employed (or your parents/spouse are), most jobs have EAPs (Employee Assistance Plans) that are 100% free and usually have a certain number of free counseling sessions and resources. They're not often advertised well, so ask HR (these programs are confidential!)

The literature says that that aerobic exercises such as walking and cycling increases BDNF in the brain, which is beneficial for the regeneration of brain cells, which in turn is beneficial for mental health. Swimming is another alternative.

I never understood how I could be so distressed by and afraid of uncertainty and the unknown, and yet at the same time so obsessed with and always seeking the same thing! I thought I was a masochist honestly! But now it makes sense. I score very high on both neuroticism and openness. 

What I mean by seeking out the unknown and also being distressed by it is, just for an example, I am incredibly interested and fascinated by knowing the parts of myself and others and the world that I am blind to or unaware of. I actively seek out views and opinions and feedback that I hope will contradict me. I crave expanding my knowledge of myself and the world. Yet I am very sensitive to criticism and feelings of shame and despair when I feel ignorant or unaware of something about either myself or some view of the world. I often get intensely distressed yet also enjoy and crave painful discoveries or new ways of seeing. ",1,0,new,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dca7xg/high_oppenneshigh_neuroticism/

969,1dc9szp,My mother insists that I do not have ADHD,"I have been speculating for many years now that I have ADHD. I am not diagnosed but I have struggled with hyperactive symptoms since I was a child, I'm now 17. Both my friends and my own mother have suggested and agreed that ADHD is something that I could very possibly have. 

About a month ago, I asked my mom about getting an ADHD diagnosis so that I could be put on adderall (at the time I thought that was the only medication for ADHD and I didn't know how intense it is). I sent the message through text while she was out of town, so I never got a reply. I wanted to be put on medication because I felt that my possible ADHD was negatively effecting my life, it made it hard to have a proper sleep schedule and focus on work at all.

Today, I was looking for a therapist, which my mom was fine with. When I showed my mom one of the therapists and said ""one of the things she helps with is listed as ADHD"", my mom got very defensive, saying that I dont have ADHD. She said she knows what ADHD looks like and I don't have it, then started yelling about how she would never let me take adderall, referring to my old text that she didn't reply to. I was very confused because she was one of the people who told me she thinks I have it. I told her that there's probably other ""less intense"" medications for ADHD and she said that they're ""all bad and all come from the same drug"".

Thoughts on the whole situation?",1,5,new,"Well I gotta say, as a neurodivergent person, your mom should take the chance and at least try to listen to you. 

It‚Äôs very common for a parent to reject the fact that their child has a disorder/disability, so you‚Äôre not alone, my dad absolutely refuses to believe that I have autism but I‚Äôve been diagnosed and I showed clear signs all of my life. 

So don‚Äôt worry, what I suggest you do is to have a clear conversation with your mom on why you think you have adhd and you need medication or simply don‚Äôt listen to what she says, because your health matters too. 

(Sorry I‚Äôm horrible at this lol) (score: 2) | It's either your mum has little knowledge about mental health and is scared of you being a lunatic or something
Or
Your mum is embarassed of you getting a therapy because it'll ruin the family's name

So now I'm here struggling with ADHD (was a bright as students two years ago, got 98% in finals exams but not I can barely pass in exams due to attention problems), depression and severe anxiety issues) (score: 1) | once you‚Äôre 18 you can do whatever you want, and you‚Äôll still be on insurance until you‚Äôre 25 if you live in the US so if that covers mental health stuff then all you‚Äôll have to pay is the co-pays at most, my copays for therapy are 20$ a session and my insurance actually covers my entire medication cost (score: 1) | They don‚Äôt all come from the same drug first of all. Also your mum sounds kinda sucky no offense. Also they don‚Äôt give you drugs without a proper diagnosis so honestly you can still get tested and not get on medication. Also you‚Äôre 17 just make an appointment and go. If they diagnose you then that‚Äôs great and you can try different medications and get a therapist to help with coping mechanisms. If you don‚Äôt then you still need help of some kind and should still get therapy. Your mother doesn‚Äôt live in your mind and has very little authority over your body at your age. If you have insurance then call around and see how much an appointment would cost you. If your mother doesn‚Äôt want to fund it that‚Äôs fine either way you still have insurance and can probably pay the fee that insurance doesn‚Äôt cover yourself. Point being she‚Äôs not a doctor, she‚Äôs not a neuroscientist and she‚Äôs certainly not a licensed therapist so her opinions on your mental health mean very little. Do what‚Äôs best for you. (score: 1) | I‚Äôd also just like to point out that being on medication for your adhd is often safer than the alternative even with side effects. There‚Äôs a lot of bad things that are common with adhd if you don‚Äôt actually treat it. Addiction is one of those things. Plus if she‚Äôs worried about you abusing it then there‚Äôs doctors out there that will have you sign med agreements and possibly drug test if requested or thought needed.

970,1dc9sjk,How do I tell my therapist about my people obsession?,"Hello. I am usually a decently spoken and articulate person but for some reason I have extreme difficulties expressing my problems in a specific sense. I know how I feel, I just always put it into words. 

I have an obsession with figuring out people. I want to know everything about them, what makes them tick, how they think, see how they react to certain things, to experiment so to speak. 

Sometimes this results in a longing for their friendship, infatuations, or just plane morbid curiosity. 

I'm able to write this now but internally this seems like a subpar explanation to what I truly feel inside.

Well unless they follow me here and if so, high!! ü§ô (score: 2) | It sounds like you're going through a lot. To tell your therapist about your people obsession, try writing down your thoughts like you did here. Bring these notes to your session to help explain your feelings.

You could say, ""I have a strong curiosity about people and want to understand everything about them, which sometimes leads to infatuations or just curiosity."" Sharing specific examples can help too.

Only a therapist can diagnose what's going on, so keep discussing your thoughts and feelings with them. It might take time, but being open is a great first step.

Otherwise, I don't know that it's really that important to 'be someone' because you are already someone... If you were nothing special, I would already know everything about you.

I'm really sorry you're feeling the way you are, and I hope it gets better. I know it's easy to compare yourself to everyone around you, but this is just a reminder that you are enough just as you are.

It was hard, terrible. I'm not sure what you've felt, but I promise having to see your dad and sister look at you with tears in their eyes, just staring. It hurts. It hurt even more when my dad started blaming himself. 
   My whole life has been a huge wreck, at least that's what I thought. Since birth, i've always feel like I had some sort of curse. When I was 5, I was assaulted by my brother. When I was 8, my parents divorced. They argued so much before that. I can still remember crying in my Build-A-Bear stuffed animal, covering my ears to stop myself from hearing those horrid screams. My dad didn't visit much after divorce, it was just me, my sister, my mom and my grandma. My mom took it hard, I knew it wasn't just going to be hard for me. She cried and cried, locked herself in her room. Meanwhile, in school I always felt teased and below everyone else. When I was 10, my parents didn't really have very healthy coping skills. My dad tried to find new love, and my mom eventually did find new love. I didn't have to take care of her anymore, but then I just had to do the same thing for the other parent. I dealt with a lot during 11-12 years old. I cant even remember it all. I did weed, nicotine, alcohol. Still somehow managed almost straight A's, but that all fell when I started my first year of high school. I felt horrible. I was struggling, I felt trapped. I hated myself for things I couldn't control, for things that I could control but all I did was rot in my bed. That led to a decision that was impulsive and wrong. 
   I went to several mental health facilities before something finally clicked. I got closer to God. I started doing a little more than just surviving. I have plans for my life. I know my life is easily privileged, but I wanted to share this. If you're stuck in bed, not able to get up, lashing out, doing stupid dumb things. It does get better.

# Howdy!

As some members have pointed out; June is Men's Mental Health Month!  
Yes, it's also pride month this month. And for those who are wondering when the Women's Mental Health Months was, that is in May (may vary per country).  



**Why is discussing Men's Mental Health so important?**    
Mental disorders affect men and women. The prevalence of several mental disorders is lower in men than in women. However, other disorders are diagnosed at comparable rates for men and women or at higher rates for men, like¬†[attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#part_2549). Men are also more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the¬†[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db330.htm).

Certain symptoms may also be more common in men than women, and the course of illness can be affected by a person‚Äôs sex. Researchers are only now beginning to tease apart the various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact mental health.

Men are less likely to have received mental health treatment than women in the past year. Recognizing the signs that you or someone you love may have a mental disorder is the first step toward getting treatment. The earlier that treatment begins, the more effective it can be.

But mainly, and that is what we have been seeing here on r/mentalhealth a lot: people assume that men don't struggle simply because¬†**they are often portrayed, or expected, to be strong and silent**. This expectation is rooted in toxic masculinity and has resulted in poor mental health outcomes for men.



https://preview.redd.it/ft787mdkqb5d1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=149a484e1ba75ac2136dbdf6c81a3f4b558601d6

A [research](https://www.priorygroup.com/blog/40-of-men-wont-talk-to-anyone-about-their-mental-health#:~:text=77%25%20of%20men%20polled%20have,negative%20stigma%22%20on%20the%20issue) has shown that: 

* **77% of men** polled have suffered with symptoms of common mental health conditions such as anxiety, stress or depression.
* **40% of men have never spoken to anyone about their mental health.**
* **29%** of those say they are ""too embarrassed"" to speak about it, while 20% say there is a ""negative stigma"" on the issue.
* **40% of men** polled said it would take thoughts of suicide or self-harm to compel them to get professional help.  

    
That last one is alarming, this means that the majority of men will not seek professional help when they struggle with suicidal or self harm thoughts! Men don't talk about their issues and often think: 'I‚Äôve learnt to deal with it', 'I don‚Äôt wish to be a burden to anyone' or ‚ÄòI have no-one to talk to‚Äô. We hope r/mentalhealth will offer you a safe place where you anonymously can share your story.

77% of men polled said they experienced some level of symptoms for common mental health problems such as anxiety, stress or depression.

But what underlying factors are driving those symptoms? Respondents were asked about the biggest causes of pressure in their life - pressures that might negatively impact their mental health.

The top three issues were:

* Work-related pressure - 32%
* Financial pressures at - 31%
* Health concerns - 23%

Is this something you recognize?

So what is? As with all complex healthcare issues, there is no easy answer when it comes to redressing the disparities in access to formal support for people of color and those from other diverse ethnic backgrounds. Nevertheless, where there is a will, there is a way!    
  
If you are struggling, it would be helpful to visit your local healthcare provider. But doing that can be scary.  
You might feel that they won't listen or are able to understand. Or you might struggling to put into words how you feel. In both cases, this [article](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/tips-for-talking-with-your-health-care-provider), will give you some tips and tools on how to talk to your primary care provider.

r/mentalhealth is a peer to peer support subreddit. Please share in the comments what has helped you!  
This can be a podcast/music/a video/a book/an article or an app (yes we will screen them for promotions).   
Or you are more than welcome to share your story on how you approached getting help IRL. Was it as difficult as you maybe thought. Would you do something different? What was the response you have gotten after asking for help? 

And if you need help, please let us know what you are dealing with. So others can give you some tips on what worked for them. Or maybe they recognize themselves in your story! 

Aside from awareness, we hope this can spark a conversation on the topic. Because conversations and connecting with eachother is what we are all about.

996,1dfjkae,Has anybody ever used antidispressants specifically to deal with grief from loss so bad you can't stand it? Someone who did not have depression previous to the loss?,"The reason why I want responses from people who specifically didn't have depression is because if you had depression, and then suffered a loss, and then went on antidepressants, it's reasonable that it would help. Cuz you had depression in the first place. 

But if your symptom is just screaming brain pain from a loss where you just can't stand the loss. And for me it's been 2 years of screaming brain from my loss.

Is this something that anyone has experienced antidepressants helping for a person who does not have clinical depression generally. I still get up and function normally, I go to the gym, I see friends, I don't sleep all day, I actually have trouble sleeping now. I cook for myself and others, I started new hobbies, I do yoga everyday, I've read self-help books,  I'm in therapy (CBT/grief), I meditate, I've looked into and read on various philosophies, especially stoicism, and the screaming in my brain just won't stop. It's too much loss.

Is this something anyone else has ever experienced and had antidepressants actually help with? Again, no pre-existing depression. ",1,0,hot,,
997,1dfjiuj,Everyone would be better off without me.,"I‚Äôm a 27 yo female. Engaged. Mom to a 2 year old. I suffer with mental illness and have been for 10+ years. As I get older, as I have more responsibilities, my mental health declines more and more. I hate myself so much. I‚Äôm so sad that my fianc√© and our child has to go through life with me. I‚Äôm not perfect. I‚Äôm pretty messed up. I have bipolar and I have mania. Im so hard on myself but I don‚Äôt want my son to have a mother like me. I love him more than life and want him to have nothing but great things. Even if that means i have to live my life without him. My fianc√© hates me, our relationship is falling apart and fast. My 2 year old is defiant towards me and has a speech delay. Which I blame on myself. I‚Äôm a sahm and I don‚Äôt do enough with him. I have already failed him and he‚Äôs only 2. All I do is cause my family problems, pain, suffering, unhappiness. My fianc√© told me I was ‚Äúnasty‚Äù towards everyone I come into contact with. He‚Äôs not wrong. I don‚Äôt treat my parents the way I should but I‚Äôm also over them and the way they have made me feel here recently. Not only that but I‚Äôm starting to become mad at the fact they don‚Äôt treat my son like what they should. My mom loves on, coddles & makes time for my older sisters 5 month old baby, whom she does have custody have, but has never done that towards/for my 2 year old. Her first time watching him by herself was in March of this year‚Ä¶. 
A part of me, the happy me, died over 10 years ago. I‚Äôm just suffering now and causing others to do so. 
The stress and the worry of not being good enough for my son eats me alive. 
Idk what to do.
I can‚Äôt continue faking. 
But I am too scared and do not have a plan.
All I want is to be happy. To be a good mom to my son. A good fianc√© to the love of my life. A good daughter. A good sister. I would say a good friend but I know I‚Äôm a good friend, not like it matters. The only friend I had lives 3 mins down the road from me. We haven‚Äôt been invited over to her house in a year. She always made excuses to not come to my house, to not see me and my son. Her brother lives down the road from me. She literally has to drive by my house to get to his. 
I‚Äôm tired of being sad, anxious and angry. 
I hope my son knows how much I love him. How he is the light to my very broken and dark spirit. 
I hope he‚Äôs nothing like me. ",1,1,hot,"**Hello u/!**

What got me personally to a level where I'm pretty much without anxiety and mostly no regrets is the following:

Then travelling was a big step for me. Let go of everything, experience tons of new things. Hitchhiking around, backpacking, hostels.

Endless adventures really.. Both amazing and terrifying and i wouldn't want it any other way.

I think this is different from acting externally that u don‚Äôt have anxiety at all but inside u r super anxious. That‚Äôs acting. In this case, if u managed to gaslight urself internally that u don‚Äôt have anxiety, then u stop feeling bad abt it.

Looking back on your past choices, you might think they're ridiculous; that's just because you're smarter and wiser now. 

Most of the time, things you regret actually end up putting you where you want to be in life, whether that be mentally or physically or both. Maybe you learn a good lesson from your mistake, maybe it leads you to a new and wonderful path in life.

All of your decisions, whether you regret them or not, are leading you to where you're supposed to be. If you genuinely try your best every day (and are ok with the fact that your best will rarely, if ever, be perfect) things will turn out okay for you. And that's all any of us can do, is try our best. So if you're doing that, you're doing great. Don't be so hard on yourself. Mistakes are what makes us human. (score: 2) | Worrying about the here and now makes any regrets less powerful. (score: 2) | I don't have regrets because I can't regret a mistake I made knowing that I made it with the best knowledge I had at that moment. Everyone makes mistakes but if you made the mistakes with good intentions, then there is nothing to regret.

Great to see someone else say this. I made the best decision at the moment with the knowledge and experience I had at the time. (score: 2) | An important lesson to learn! (score: 1) | The first comment covers a good bit of what I will say.  It‚Äôs so very easy to ruminate and dwell on our mistakes in life. So much so, we almost forget about successes that we have had. The person you were when you made those mistakes be it months ago, years ago, decades ago etc etc. is not the person you are now. 

dwelling on negatives all the time as all you‚Äôll see and predict for yourself is gonna be negative. If your glasses are covered in shit all you‚Äôll see is shit pretty much.  

Speaking from my own experience I used to always dwell or run through every mistake I had made and even talk them out loud to myself and instead of thinking how it‚Äôs shaped me all I did was allow it to be a facilitator for more mistakes. Telling myself ‚Äúof course I‚Äôll fuck up i always do‚Äù that then led me to fuck up. 

What helped me was thinking about all the times good things happened as I said above think of the successes you have had. Doesn‚Äôt matter how big, small they are. Just successes in general. People you‚Äôve helped, good things you‚Äôve done, work, college etc etc.  logically the same way fuck how happen, is the same way good things happen. Just another side of the coin. 

Might have rambled a bit there but I wish you all the best and hope you get through what you are going through. (score: 1) | I turn them into lessons.

(score: 1) | Okay i am being 100% serious here but there was a quote i heard in a movie when i was younger and from time to time its helped me cope a lot with my past and with my lack of accomplishments. It goes ""Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, but Today is a gift. That is why it is called the present"". (score: 1) | Kung foo panda (score: 2) | It depends on the regret, but I think forgiveness for the self and taking accountability. Understanding situations gives you more comfort, and it helps you to not repeat making the same mistake or making other similar mistakes. Mistakes help us learn, as long as we do our best to make up for negative actions it the next step is just to move on and use the knowledge for something better. It‚Äôs like a fight to keep moving on, learning, and evolving. I feel bad sometimes for the people I‚Äôve hurt but I can‚Äôt change the past, no one can save them but themselves. Also for the people who‚Äôve hurt me I try to forgive and just move on, usually hurt people have their own issues. Trying to understand the situation helps though, it‚Äôs like history is bound to repeat itself if we forget right. So ignoring things helps but it‚Äôs like a bit of push and pull, ignore certain things but then try to understand other things, then once you understand move on. (score: 1) | I don't matter. 

I am of no value, rhe things I fuck up or do right have no value. The people I choose are all that matter. And if I fuck up with them it's up to them to give me value and choose me back.

I'm not all that afraid of fucking up because most of the time it's going to be okay. No trauma or physical suffering, just a bit more work. So it has virtually no impact, and thus of no value. (score: 1) | To live with regrets, accept them as part of life and learn from your mistakes. Forgive yourself and focus on enjoying the present. One day at a time! (score: 1) | What have you learned along the way? ‚ÄúNot amounting to anything‚Äù indicates a destination that you feel you haven‚Äôt arrived at yet but what insight, freedom, wisdom, etc, have you collected along the way?

Biggest one is listening to my wife at the time to not invest in Bitcoin in 2011 (we divorced not too long after that for other reasons). I would have potentially made $200M if I invested the amount I was going to and if I held onto it all.

I just constantly think about positives in my life. Simple things. I‚Äôm alive, I have all my senses, that type of stuff. I also set goals for myself. Make the bed,  do a chore or something around the house daily. Small things like that make me more productive and feel accomplished. (score: 1) | Learn from them.  Like somebody else said, I‚Äôm not the same person I was when I did things I regret.  When I think back, I don‚Äôt like who I was.  But I just try to be better than I was. (score: 1) | Recognize your faults and maladaptive/harmful patterns. Make peace with the person you have been, do your actual best to do better onwards, and if necessary, actively do things to try to maturely and responsibly make up for regrettable things you have done in a genuine way. Everybody fucks up, to varying degrees. Accepting and knowing this while also recognizing the weight of your actions and knowing that there are things that can be done about them is essential to being able to exist without just constantly wishing you could slam a restart button imo. (score: 1) | Regrets and anxiety can be really tough to handle. Remember, everyone makes mistakes, and it doesn‚Äôt mean you haven‚Äôt achieved anything.

Try to be kind to yourself and focus on small positive steps. Talking to a therapist can also help a lot with managing these feelings.

You‚Äôre not alone, and it‚Äôs never too late to make changes. Take care. (score: 1) | I live because pain reminds me I‚Äôm alive. Death to me is permanent. No pain, no joy; nothing. If you feel pain, you are here to experience life. Even if my life is full of pain and suffering, I‚Äôd rather have that than absolute nothingness. This might be different for people who believe in an afterlife. (score: 1) | It helps to see yourself like other people do, you will realize that your actions weren‚Äôt as bad as you think they are now. We are much tougher on ourselfs than anyone, so just try to forgive yourself and understand why you did those things: it couldn‚Äôt be just pure evil, you must have had a reason, so try to be understanding with the person you were when you made those mistakes. (score: 1) | I try to forget them and block them out (score: 1) | Like swimming in muddy waters. Heavy and overwhelming. 3am seem to be the time where the ""most embarassing things you've done"" bilboard hits start to replay. (score: 1) | The biggest thing is the ability to forgive yourself and realize what was and wasn‚Äôt your fault. What was your fault, you use to learn and grow and possibly seek forgiveness, what wasn‚Äôt your fault, then you no longer need to regret. There‚Äôs also just facing the reality of we can‚Äôt change the past. Of letting it go because there‚Äôs (to some) no point in reminiscing, this usually comes easier though so long as you‚Äôve forgiven yourself and also did everything you need to make amends, and sometimes we very well just can‚Äôt make amends and just accept that and move forward. 

You don‚Äôt sound like you have really bad anxiety, you sound like you have really bad trauma. A therapist in emdr might help. If you‚Äôre always self sabotaging, you have to heal that deep seated hatred in order to move forward easier. And also remember, it‚Äôs never too late, and if you‚Äôre younger, you have so much time. It‚Äôs not a race. (score: 1) | If you rewire your mind & thoughts to think that you did what you knew best in the past moment, and you learned a lesson to be better because if what happened, you will not feel regret anymore. If you have to apologize or acknowledge something to someone in the past, do it. free yourself from these burdens. Gradually things will be better and you wont feel the same. 

Also forgive yourself for you past versions . You cant be at war with yourself all the time. Its exhausting. Do better with waht you know now. I hope everything works out for you.

A plan was set out for me and I am someday destined to finally break free from my regrets. I'm still really young so I really hold on to that belief, that tiny hope that my life is far from over and I still have time to make the right choices for myself :) (score: 1) | The past is not my concern, neither is the future.

But now that i can see my past self from another perspective i will try to help.

In theory you need to accept that the past is the past and you can‚Äôt change it and so you need to pardon yourself about what happened or didn't happened (not forget because it‚Äôs pretty much impossible and i think it‚Äôs not a good thing anyway)

In practice it‚Äôs really hard and you can‚Äôt just convinced yourself like that .Given the way you write, I get the impression that you have a low opinion of yourself, that you struggle to see the positive things you could do, but that you tend to notice more the negative impact you could have. I think the best thing for you is to change your daily routine. First, if you haven't already and if you have the possibility, try going to therapy, as it could help you a lot. But also, do things you enjoy or try new things. Acquire new skills or find new people to get along with and try to see the positive outcomes. Negative thoughts and regrets will always be there. You have to learn to live with them. But for that to happen, they must no longer have a daily impact. That means being able to think about them without being affected and without constantly dwelling on them. I may not be the best person to give advice, as it was an external event that helped me move on. But this change, it must be provoked in one way or another. Situations are different for everyone, so maybe you don't need social contact like I did. But perhaps you need to do something where you feel you have some importance. For example, helping people in need or something else, if possible. You're not a superhero, you can't help the whole world. And all the negative things that happen, even if you may be partly responsible, are not solely because of you. You need to be more objective with yourself. And I think the best way is to try to think of someone you appreciate, and imagine that it's them who did those things, to try to minimize the impact you may have had. 


To summarize this lengthy message, seek help wherever you can, whether it's among your loved ones or through therapy if possible. To help you in your daily life, try to do things that bring you satisfaction or make you proud. Even small accomplishments can really help. The goal is to try to realize that you're not a monster, that even if bad things have happened, and even if it's your fault, everyone messes up at some point, and that doesn't mean you should hate yourself for it. I know it's difficult, but it's the only way to get better. Because continuing to blame yourself and doing nothing about it will only destroy you.

999,1dc19dy,I did it. I paid for dinner.,"I got my first ever salary after completing my undergrad and postgrad. I took my family out to dinner today to a 5 star hotel. I took the bill from my father's hand as I said I'll be handling it today and paid for it. Here it's why it was special for me.

I come from a poor family. This tale is from when I was 6 or 7. I was out with my father to his office and while returning, I said that I was hungry and we went a street side shop, I ate happily. My father didn't eat. After completing the meal, he asked me if I wanted to eat more but I said no. We then boarded the public bus, he took out wallet and emptied it for the bus fare. I asked then how we would have gone home if had paid for extra food which I said no to, he just smiled and never gave me a response. I always had a lot of conflicts with my father, but that incident always reminded of the great father he is and I will never be as selfless as him. So, when I took the bill today and made the payment, he gave the similar warm smile like the one he gave me on that bus. I did it guys, he didn't say anything to me after that.

First and foremost, are you safe and cared for where you're living now? Are you getting enough food to eat, able to access clean water, clean clothes, sleeping in a bed, and free from violence? What about your sister? If not, please consider telling a teacher, doctor, or therapist what's going on. 

If you can't access one of them, please consider calling child protective services. They will work to help and support your family, keep you safe, and hopefully get your parents to a place where you and your sister would be safe enough to come home. They will do their best to keep you safe and maybe even find a relative that you can stay with in the meantime. They will never tell your parents who called or what exactly was said.

Your plan to get a GED is a strong one and is definitely something you should try to do. Focus on that and getting through one day at a time.

Please know that what your parents are going through is not your fault and doesn't mean that you'll end up the same way. Pain killers can be a horrible thing that can poison people's minds in ways that cause them to spin out of control.

Your parents' inability to get clean and stay sober is not a reflection of their love or affection for you. Addiction rewires brains and bodies in the worst possible way and tries to do everything in its power to maintain control. 

The only way a person suffering from addiction can get clean and stay clean is if they want it so bad *for themselves* that they're willing to go through excruciating pain and a torturous hell to get through withdrawals. Most people are so depressed, embarrassed, and ashamed of their addiction that they don't see themselves as worth/deserving of the fight to get clean. Hence, the inability to get clean, even if they want it. Getting clean for anyone or anything else will almost always result in failure, no matter how much you love them. 

Your life, everything you will accomplish in your life, and the example you will set *when* you get through this all have so much more value than you will ever be able to comprehend. The best parts of your life are coming and you deserve every minute of the joy, peace, happiness, love, and comfort that's coming. Don't deny your sister, her brother. Don't deny yourself a happy ending. Don't let addiction take your life the way it's taking theirs. Shit sucks right now, but you will get through it.

1002,1dfjlss,"As someone with diagnosed complex PTSD from childhood trauma, I like what they are showing with The Homelander. (even if it's taken to extremes)","

This Post was removed from The Boys subreddit so I'm sharing here

**Warning**: This post is surrounding PTSD behaviours from experience (others will be different).

*Note: No condonement of character actions, just what is being presented specifically to the above.*   


I like the fractured sense of self they show. How different parts of you can control and interact with each other is quite interesting to see, its also not a topic that gets shown that much.

As someone who has experienced severe abusive childhood and had to deal with the related issues it causes, I'm glad they have found a way to show this on screen. I'm not sure if that's the intent. It hits me deep.

Even once I got out of that place of abuse, the cycle still continued for me. I would engage in behaviours that would hurt me and by extension those around me. But it was like I couldn't stop. I wanted to feel bad, I wanted to feel shamed, but why? I didn't know.

A very problematic symptom was when I felt good about anything, and I do literally mean anything, intense crippling anxiety would occur, I couldn't remain still or present, I would get extremely hot and my heart would race and my body would tense to the point of pain. I felt scared and uncomfortable. Often feelings of like ""running away""

Feeling good, it was foreign to me, so those other parts came in to protect me, for me abuse and shame were normal and those parts came in to ensure that the uncomfortable went away.  But that's a very hard cycle to break and for me, even recognize as an issue. I couldn't possibly reflect on what was happening.

This caused and increasing amount of disassociation, at the start it was smaller moments, but as things spiraled so did the length of time. Losing five hours of time, with no memory is an unnerving experience. 

Having your partner have to fill you in on the last few hours because accidentally bumped your toe triggered something is also not a great experience.

I didn't think about getting professional help at all due to the mockery of psychological issues in media and really just not realizing I had trauma related issues.  So they are going unrecognized, undiagnosed and untreated with constant spiraling escalation.

I was more or less forced into professional help, however getting that help was a important first step, and with my partners extreme love and support and combined help with a psychologist things became less extreme. Even now its still a complex and hard issue to manage.

The Homelander has none of those support systems and his own terrible actions ensure that spiral will continue. I appreciate that they have shown the fractured parts of self in the show, that the abused child is still in there, somewhere, still being abused and controlled.

I know its a show about superheroes and might not be taken seriously, but I like that its showing the fractured of self on multiple levels. Its shows the hurt child that wants love, its shows the self hatred and shame, its shows the control, its shows the internal and external destruction, its shows the escalation of these issues, it shows the dissociation.

As someone with a extremely fractured and chaotic sense of self and normality its nice to see the issue presented in the entertainment, even if taken to the absolute extreme.

How do I not do all this and just accept my logical thoughts initially even though I have this high feeling of doubt about my solution associated with them.

1008,1dfk62l,A predator relative ruined the way I see things and I have no clue what to do.,"I posted this a while ago and it got absolutely 0 replies or advice. So I simply tried forgetting. Recently though, something reminded me of this, and I'm starting all the progress of forgetting over from the start again. Also, for context, I'm a dude, which may be important but may not be? I don't really know.

So i'm not really going to elaborate, but let's just say my cousin did some very bad shit to my sister. I never knew anything happened or was happening, and the whole time we were just totally fine. I never even knew. Until I knew. The man is a monster.  

Fast forward to after all this was revealed to me, a ton of stuff is totally tainted now and it's making me super sad. I used to love rebuilding computers, but ever since I found out about what he did and that he did that too, it just reminds me of him. I used to love playing multi-player games with him since he was good at only some of them and I was good at most of them so I'd usually beat him (I admit I did take advantage of that). 

A few days ago (a few MONTHS ago, this is old but applies) I was playing an online game and thought about the times i played it with him, and then thought about what he did, and then remembered that he made me sit on his lap while playing and that train of thoughts was so disturbing I literally froze while playing the game while online. It must have been 5 minutes or so of me just sitting there listening to Team Fortress noises blasting in the background having some sort of terrible mental event until I finally sort of ""snapped back"" and just shut the computer off and went to bed. I havent opened it since out of fear of being reminded of him. I feel bad for my teammates, because I'm sure I probably made them lose.  

Even my college planning is getting screwed up. My current choice of college is a community College, and since I'm kinda dumb and also kinda poor, it's the only option I have. Fine school, but it reminds me of him. I'm genuinely not sure how to handle possible taking classes in a school he went to. I even remember visiting him once. I'm considering crossing it off my list. (Even months later this is still true, but sadly it's like the only college I can get in in range of me that isn't either extremely suspicious, online, or a trade school.)

Hell, now that it's been a few months since I wrote some of this I notice that even my *laugh* sometimes reminds me of him. Now I want to reprogram my throat so I can stop thinking of that vile monster when I start laughing. Thank God me and the rest of my family have a restraining order on him, but he's *STILL* fucking with me. 

What do I do? Do I try to just avoid being reminded, or do I try to ""reclaim"" these things? Do I support my sister first or do I focus on fixing myself first?",1,1,top,"**Hello u/!**
